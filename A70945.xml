         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>This good man had high natural abilities, which were heightned by induſtry, and brightened by his graces, but he always had a low eſteem of himſelf and his ſervices. When he was on his death-bed, he ſaid,

that he judged not any of his papers wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy publiſhing, but yet he looked upon theſe as moſt probably profitable.

By his opening the Scripture Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphors, which familiarly reveile Chriſt, beſides the many notions which ſhall be beamed into the underſtanding, the ſerious-muſing-Chriſtian will be much advantaged in occaſional meditations.</p>
            <p>If when theſe Sermons have been dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently peruſed, there could be a clear diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery annexed of the Authors gifts for prayer (which were more then ordinary) to gether with his pious winning converſation, cheerful readineſſe to be aſſiſtant in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious exerciſes (wherein he was lovely and exemplary) Then the judicious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der would lamentingly ſay, Oh how great was <hi>Londons</hi> loſſe by the death of worthy Maſter <hi>Robinſon</hi> taken away in his youth, when growing towards greater ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity for the further ſervice of the Church of Chriſt.

For thus we argue; Might not man extirpate a vegitative plant, growing in the field of foes, becauſe it was a means of life, how great divine diſpleaſure then do thoſe providences expreſſe againſt this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Nation, whereby moſt generous plants in Gods own Orchard are cut down, and caſt into the duſt!

Treatiſe with very many more excellent books, the fruits of the heads &amp; hearts of Gods worthies (with the expectation of more, to be made publick) for our confirmation and edification in grace, but we enjoy the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of many famous, orthodox, learned, rightly conſtituted Miniſters, both in this City and other parts of this Nation, whoſe lives and liberties, with hearts to do ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, are ſtill continued through Gods mercy, notwithſtanding <hi>our all-forfeiting ſins;</hi> together with the malice of Satan, and the inveterate rage of his inſtruments, who act againſt the Goſpel under differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent diſguiſes and apprehenſions, of whom we may ſay; <hi>They compaſſed us about, yea,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>3. And this eſpecially doth relieve our ſpirits, that the Almighty (upon whom we do and will depend) is independant and <note place="margin">Iſa. 26. 4.</note> unchangeable.

            <p>And firſt he ſtirs them up to the more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ſtudy of heavenly things, by many Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, <hi>verſe</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>If ye be riſen with Christ, ſeek thoſe things that are above.</hi>

            <p>Secondly, he perſwades them to mortifie their earthly members, thoſe vitious motions and affections of corrupt nature, which were ſtill too ſtrong in them: he doth not only urge this in general, but inſtances in many particulars, all which are preſſed by ſeveral Arguments, <hi>verſe</hi> 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Amongſt other Arguments this is one, <hi>They have put off the old man, and put on the new man,</hi> ver. 9, 10. This new man he deſcribes three wayes.

of our nature, which we loſt in <hi>Adam.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it conſiſts in the knowledge of the myſtery of the Goſpel. Thirdly, the example or Archetype according to which this new man is faſhioned, is the image of God our Creator. This Argument the Apoſtle follows, <hi>verſe</hi> 11. he ſets it on two wayes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By removing the falſe opinion of ſome, who neglecting this new man, did confide in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal priviledges, and contemned all ſuch as wanted them; this in the former part of the verſe, where there is neither Greek, nor Jew, &amp;c. that is, in this new man it matters not what Nation a perſon be of, whether he be Jew or Gentile; nor doth it matter what outward prerogatives a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon have, whether he be circumciſed, or uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed; nor doth it matter what his outward ſtate be, whether he be bond or free, &amp;c. none of all theſe differences are looked at or conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. No man is more accepted of God for the having of any of theſe things, nor is any leſs eſteemed of him for the want of them, <hi>There is neither Jew, nor Greek, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. By oppoſing the true opinion; <hi>But Chriſt is all, and in all. Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The words are a Propoſition. In which we have,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Subject, Chriſt; <hi>But Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Predicate, <hi>He is all, and in all.</hi> He is all things that are neceſſary to ſalvation, and that in all perſons, who do beleeve in him, who are renued and regenerated by his grace. I intend to go over all the compariſons by which Jeſus Chriſt is ſet out in Scripture. And I have begun with this as a Preface or introduction to the reſt.

            </p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>The Lord Jeſus Chriſt is all things in and to all perſons that have a true ſaving intereſt in him; Chriſt is all and in all.</hi> It doth not exclude the Father and Holy Ghoſt but all other things, as circumciſion, uncircumciſion, &amp;c. A like phraſe. <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 12. Chriſt is all and in all to every beleever. Here are two rules to be obſerved. 1. <hi>We are not to underſtand this (as excluding the other perſons of the Trinity,)</hi> for the whole God-head is all in alto beleevers as well as Jeſus Chriſt. But becauſe Jeſus Chriſt the ſecond perſon of the Trinity is the head of the myſtical body, by vertue of which union true beleevers are made one myſtical bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. <hi>ult.</hi> therefore is this principally appropriated to him, to be all in all to thoſe that are united to him by ſaving faith. 2. <hi>The truth of this propoſition is not from the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, but from the divine:</hi> it is from the power of the divine nature in Chriſt, that he is all in all to his people; becauſe the fulneſſe of the God-head dwells bodily in the humane nature as a part of the perſon. Now he is all in all to them in theſe five reſpects, <hi>viz.</hi>

1. <hi>By way of merit.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt is meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly all in all to beleevers. Whatſoever they are, whatſoever they have, whatſoever they do, or can expect, is only upon the ſcore and account of his purchaſe and merit. They enjoy no good thing upon any other termes, but only upon the conſideration of Chriſts merits. Becauſe he hath done and ſuffered for them, and in their ſtead, therefore do they partake of thoſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings which make them happy to all eternity. The Patriarchs in the Old Teſtament, Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in the New, have pleaded with God for all bleſſings only upon the account of Chriſt. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 17. cauſe thy face to ſhine upon thy Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, that is deſolate, for the <hi>Lords ſake.</hi> Of this the Apoſtle ſpeaks, when he ſaith, that Chriſt <hi>is made unto us of God wiſdom, righteouſneſſe, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification and redemption,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 30. Chriſt doth beſtow upon us, and God is pleaſed to accept for us the merit of Chriſts Paſſion, death, obedience, and righteouſneſſe.—</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Chriſt is all in all to them by way of convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</hi> As he hath merited all for them: ſo 'tis from him and through him that all good things are communicated to them, <hi>John</hi> 14. 6. As we have all <hi>propter Chriſtum,</hi> ſo we receive all we have, <hi>per Chriſtum</hi> through Chriſt. He is not only the fountaine, but the <hi>Medium</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit through whom all a beleever hath is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to him. Jeſus Chriſt is a beleevers root, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 5. Now as all the ſap which is in the branches is communicated through the root, ſo all the good which a beleever hath is derived through Chriſt. God hath put all that good he intends to beſtow upon his Elect into Chriſts hands as a Feoffee in truſt, and from him as the

            <p n="3">3. <hi>Chriſt is all in all to them, by way of efficiency and cauſality.</hi> He it is that works all in all in his Saints, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 6. <hi>There are diverſities of opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but it is the ſame God which worketh all in all.</hi> This our Saviour bears witneſſe unto, <hi>John</hi> 15. 5. when he tells us, that <hi>without him we can do nothing.</hi> The ſoul is the principle of all action in man, Jeſus Chriſt is the principle of all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſpiritual action in his Saints, for he is the ſoul of their ſoule. Not a good deſire, not a good thought but what is inſpired by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.

            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Chriſt is all in all to them virtually;</hi> he is inſtead of all things to them. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith that money anſwereth all things, <hi>Ecoleſ.</hi> 10. 19. it is meat, drink, cloaths, houſe, lands, &amp;c. all things that are vendible may be procured by money. Jeſus Chriſt is <hi>virtually</hi> all things, he makes up all things that are wanting. Hence it is that he is in Scripture compared to all things, to food, to cloathing, to phyſick, to gold, to health, &amp;c. becauſe he ſtands for all theſe things unto the ſoules of his Saints.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:38484:11"/>
Hence is that promiſe, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 7. <hi>He that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh ſhall inherit all things.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt is for all uſes and purpoſes. This is in the text; he is Circumciſion to the Gentile, wiſdome to the Barbarian, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Christ is all in all to them by way of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and ſanctification.</hi> It is from him that any good they enjoy becomes a bleſſing to them. He makes every thing effectual for thoſe ends for which they are appointed. No good thing would be good to us without the benediction of Chriſt; yea were it not for his bleſſing, every good thing would prove a ſnare, a croſſe and a curſe to us, as they do to them, who have no intereſt in Chriſt. This is that which <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 22. <hi>The bleſſing of the Lord, it maketh rich.</hi> Thy health would be thy greateſt ſickneſſe, thy wealth would be thy ruine, thy parts and abilities would be a ſnare to thee, did not Jeſus Chriſt ſanctifie them by his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.

of helps as theſe are. If Chriſt be all in all, then theſe are ſuperfluous, yea, the addition of theſe doth derogate from, and deſtroy the fulneſſe and al-ſufficiency of Chriſt. Yea Chriſt who is all in all to beleevers, will be nothing at all to them who are not contented with him alone. <hi>Chriſt is become of none effect to you, whoſoever of you are juſtified by the law, ye are fallen from grace,</hi> Gal. 5. 4. Conſider this you that are ſelf juſtitiaries.</p>
               <p>Uſe 2. <hi>If Chriſt be all in all, then is nothing any thing at all without Jeſus Christ.</hi> All the world, the riches, pleaſures, honours of the world is but emptineſſe without Chriſt. <hi>Vanity of vanities, all is vanity,</hi> Eccleſ. 1. 2. that man hath juſt nothing, that hath not Chriſt who is all things; the world is but <hi>nigrum nihil.</hi> Thy wiſdome, thy parts, thy children, thy offices, thy prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, thy lands and revenews, all thou haſt, if thou want him that is all things, can amount to nothing.

                  <hi>ſo fearful of loſing Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> They value all things at a low rate in compariſon of him. They would rather loſe all then Chriſt, they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to part with liberty, eſtate, life, rather then with Chriſt. Is there not cauſe for it? Chriſt is better then all things elſe. Riches are ſomething, liberty is ſomething, life is ſomething, but Chriſt is all in all. There is nothing beſides Jeſus Chriſt that is good for all uſes. Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are good to cover, but not for food; meat is good to feed, but not to warme, &amp;c. but Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is good for every uſe, for all perſons, for all times, for all ſexes, for all conditions. They know if they loſe Chriſt, they loſe all things. If a man had all his eſtate in one jewel, you would not blame him to be very careful of keeping that. Jeſus Chriſt is their all, they ſeek him when they are deprived of him, with greateſt care; they keep him when they have him, with the greateſt diligence, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. <hi>ult.

               <p>Uſe 5. <hi>That no ſoul eſteemes Chriſt aright, that doth not eſteem him all in all.</hi> To eſteem any thing equal to Chriſt, is to diſeſteem Chriſt. Thou doſt never truly account him <hi>any thing,</hi> till thou do account him <hi>all things,</hi> yea, better then all things, and all things as nothing in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of him. If thou canſt not make up all things in Chriſt, thou makeſt him but a poore Chriſt. If thou canſt not make him a friend in the want of a friend; an habitation in the want of an habitation; if thou canſt not make him riches in poverty; if there be any condition in which Chriſt will not ſuffice thee; if Chriſt be

too little to ſatisfie thee, thou doſt but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value him; he is never truly accounted any thing, till he be accounted all things.</p>

            <p n="1">1. Jeſus Chriſt is a beleevers life.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That Chriſt who is a Beleevers life ſhall appear. Of theſe in Order.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt is a Beleevers life.</hi> For the underſtanding of this, we are to know that a Beleever hath a twofold life, for I ſhall not ſpeak here of the life of nature, which a beleever enjoys not as a beleever, but as a reaſonable creature. Jeſus Chriſt is a beleevers life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as he lives the life of nature, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 28. in him we live, move, and have our being. 'Tis from Chriſt that we live the life of men. But to wave that, a beleever as a beleever, hath a double life. 1. <hi>The life of grace,</hi> which he lives after he is regenerated by vertue of the Spirit of Chriſt living in him, and uniting him to God by Faith. 2. <hi>The life of glory,</hi> which he ſhall live in heaven to all eternity after this life. The ſoul begins this life immediately upon its departure out of the body, and the body ſhall enter into the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this life immediately after the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and reunion of ſoul and body.</p>
            <p>Both theſe kindes of life are a Beleevers, as he is a beleever; and Jeſus Chriſt is a Beleevers life in reference to both theſe. And becauſe both of theſe are included in the Text, the one of them, the life of grace is but the inchoation of, and a preparation to the life of glory; I ſhall ſpeak of both of them in the handling of the Doctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:38484:14"/>
               <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is a beleevers ſpiritual life.</hi> He is ſo to a beleever in theſe foure reſpects.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>He is their life originally.</hi> It is Jeſus Chriſt that works this life in their ſoules. He is the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator and Former of life in them. The ſecond <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam was made a quickning ſpirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 45. As the father raiſeth the dead, and quickneth them, ſo <hi>the Sonne quickneth whom he will,</hi> Joh. 5. 21. Thy ſoul had never fetched out ſpiritual breath, had not Jeſus Chriſt breathed into it the breath of life. <hi>The time cometh and now is, when the dead ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear ſhall live,</hi> Joh. 5. 25. The Ordinances are the inſtrumental cauſe, but Jeſus Chriſt is the efficient cauſe of the animating of the ſoul by a ſpiritual life.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>He is their life materially.</hi> He is that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple by which they live. Every living Creature hath ſome intrinſecal principle of that life which it lives. Jeſus Chriſt is the inward principle of a beleevers life. He is the ſoule of their ſoule. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of this, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. <hi>I am cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified with Chriſt: nevertheleſſe I live, yet not I, but Christ lives in me.</hi> It is only by vertue of the ſoules union with Chriſt, that it comes to live the life of grace. He is the foundation, or form, as I may ſay, of their life.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>He is their life conſervativè.</hi> He it is that doth preſerve this ſpiritual life in their ſoules; by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual communication of himſelf; he maintains and upholds the life of grace from dying and periſhing. When they are ſleepy, he awakeneth them; when they languiſh and faint, he reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers them. <hi>He ſtrengthens the things which remain, that are ready to die.</hi> He removes thoſe inward diſtempers which waſte this ſpiritual life, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:38484:15"/>
be bleſſeth thoſe Ordinances which feed this life. When <hi>David</hi> was going down the hill, and in regard of this ſpiritual life was almoſt at the duſt of death, ſo weak that he could ſcarce fetch his breath, Jeſus Chriſt did reſtore and renew him again. <hi>He restoreth my ſoul,</hi> Pſal. 23. 3. he caſt water upon the dying plant, and made it green and vigorous again. Of this the Apoſtle, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 3. <hi>our life is hid with Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>He is their life, exemplariter.</hi> He is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and pattern according to which they are to live. Jeſus Chriſt is the rule according to which they are to walk; he is the copy accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to which they are to write. One end of the incarnation and life of Jeſus in the fleſh, was to ſet us an exact and perfect pattern for our imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 21.

aſſerts this clearly, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 1, 12. he tells them at the firſt verſe, <hi>That they were dead in ſins and treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes,</hi> he gives them the reaſon, <hi>v.</hi> 12. <hi>becauſe at that time they were without Chriſt.</hi> And ſo ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Apoſtle tells us, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 12. <hi>He that hath the Sonne hath life; but he that hath not the Sonne hath not life.</hi> Till Chriſt be formed, the ſoul is a dead thing without either life or motion. And this is a very miſerable condition; for a dead ſoule is far worſe then a dead body, in as much as the ſoul is more excellent then the body. Conſider a few particulars. 1. <hi>Dead ſouls are loathſome.</hi> Nothing more noiſome then a dead body. <hi>By this time he ſtinketh,</hi> Joh. 11. 39. <hi>Let me bury my dead out of my ſight,</hi> ſaith <hi>Abraham,</hi> even his wife, <hi>Gen.</hi> 23. 4. ſhe that was the delight of his ſoul while ſhe was alive, became noiſom to him when ſhe was dead. The ſoule that is ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dead, is very loathſome, both to God and man. The Scripture compares them to ſtinking carrion; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14. 3. They are altogether become ſtinking. They defile all that comes neer them; whatſoever they meddle with, whatſoever touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them is defiled by them. 2. <hi>They that are ſpiritually dead, have no uſe of any of their ſpiritual ſenſes.</hi> The ſoul hath ſenſes as well as the body, but he that is dead cannot uſe any of theſe. They cannot heare, they cannot ſee, they cannot taſte, they cannot ſmell, they cannot feele, they cannot heare Chriſts voice in the Goſpel, they cannot ſee the glory of Chriſt, nor of grace, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not feel the heavy weight of ſinne, they cannot taſte the ſweet and delicate pleaſures of Jeſus Chriſt, they cannot ſmell the fragrancy of Chriſts ſweet ointments. They have no pleaſure in thoſe things that are moſt pleſant in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:38484:16"/>
and moſt deſirable to ſuch as are ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally alive: They are to all ſpiritual things, and all ſpiritual things are to them as if they were not. 3. <hi>This ſpiritual death, if it be not removed, is a certaine forerunner of eternal Death.</hi> Bleſſed and happy is he that hath part in the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, of him the ſecond death ſhall have no power, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20 6. but he that continues ſtill in this ſpiritual death, ſhall for ever be under the power of the ſecond death, the eternal death. And this is the ſtate of all ſuch as want Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Uſe 2. <hi>That that ſpiritual life which is in the ſoul of a beleever, ſhall never totally and finally die.</hi> It may be at deaths door, it may be ready to die, ſo it was with the Church of <hi>Sardis,</hi> Rev. 3. 2. A Chriſtian may be in regard of his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual life, as a tree in the depth of winter, no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to all outward appearance between him and a dead plant; but it is impoſſible that the ſpiritual life ſhall utterly be extinguiſhed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Jeſus Chriſt who is our ſpiritual life, lives for ever. <hi>Your life is hid with Chriſt in God,</hi> Col. 3. 3. hid as in a root, for ſafety and ſecurity. <hi>Becauſe I live, ye ſhall live alſo,</hi> John 14. 19. while the root liveth, the plant cannot die; while the fountaine runneth, the ſtreames cannot ceaſe; while the <hi>olive-trees convey their oyle through the pipes into the lamp,</hi> the lamp cannot go out. A living Chriſtian may grow very weak, but he cannot die. Jeſus Chriſt muſt ceaſe to live, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the life of grace in a Saint do utterly periſh; while the cauſe continueth, the effect will.</p>
               <p>Uſe 3. <hi>That there is a true ſpiritual union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Ieſus Chriſt and a beleever.</hi> This is one of the great myſteries of the Goſpel, that Chriſt and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:38484:16"/>
a beleever ſhould be made one; its ſet out by many examples, as of root and branches, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. <hi>init.</hi> head and members, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 3. foundation-ſtone, and the ſuperſtructory ſtones, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 20. meat and eaters, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6, 56. husband and wife, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 32. This very doctrine makes it good. He could not be our life, if he were not united to us, and we to him. 'Tis by vertue of our union with him, that we come to draw life from him. As the ſoul and body are united, ſo are Chriſt and a beleever; the whole myſtical body is called by his name, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12. <hi>ſo alſo is Chriſt,</hi> ſpeaking of the Church.</p>
               <p>Uſe 4. <hi>Deadneſſe of Spirit, want of ſpiritual Activity is very inexcuſable in a beleever.</hi> The ground of this inference is very cleare, Jeſus Chriſt is his life. Chriſt hath life enough in him, and he is willing enough to communicate more and more of this ſpiritual life. If the fountaine of this life were a meer creature, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing might be ſaid for thy deadneſſe and cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; but now ſeeing Jeſus Chriſt is thy life, thy deadneſſe is inexcuſable in thy ſelf, and it is alſo diſhonourable to Chriſt. The life and greenneſſe of the branches, is an honour to the root by which they live. Spiritual greenneſſe and fruitfulneſſe is in a beleever an honour to Jeſus Chriſt, who is his life. <hi>Pſal</hi> 92. 12, 13, 14, 15. <hi>The righteous ſhall flouriſh as a Palm-tree, &amp;c. To ſhew that the Lord is upright, &amp;c.</hi> The fulneſſe of Chriſt is manifeſted by the fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>Uſe 5. <hi>It is the duty of a Chriſtian to live comfortably on this Doctrine.</hi> It affords very much comfort, 1. <hi>Againſt the weakneſſe of this life in our ſelves.</hi> What Chriſtian is there but finds this
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:38484:17"/>
life very weak in him at ſome times? well, when it is weakeſt in thee, it is then ſtrong in Jeſus Chriſt. And God looks upon thy ſpiritual life, not only as it is in thee, but as it is in Chriſt. 2. <hi>Against the fear of the wanting of the Ordinances of life.</hi> 'Tis a great loſſe to loſe the Ordinances, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. 31. Well, though thou loſe theſe, yet thou doeſt not loſe thy life. Theſe are but the pipes, Chriſt is the Olive-tree. Theſe are but the chanels, Chriſt is the fountaine. Man liveth not by bread alone, but by the word of bleſſing. Thy ſoul liveth by Chriſt, not by Ordinances. They are but the inſtrumental cauſe, Chriſt is the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. 3. <hi>Againſt the feare of Satans workings to destroy this ſpiritual life.</hi> 'Tis his great deſigne to take away this ſpiritual life. He labours to ſtifle it by ſinne; he ſtirs up his inſtruments to remove the Ordinances. Well, he cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile. He muſt deſtroy Chriſt before he can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy our life. He muſt either wither the root, or he cannot kill the branches.</p>
               <p>Uſe 6. <hi>Let beleevers be careful to carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves towards Chriſt as he who is their life.</hi> 1. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him the Authour of your life. 2. Go to him when you want life. 3. Strengthen your union with him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 15. 4. Live to him who is your life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 8.</p>
               <p>Uſe 7. <hi>It ſhould invite all to lay hold on Chriſt.</hi> All men are dead by nature. There's no other way to live a ſpiritual life. If Chriſt be not thy life of grace, he will never be thy life of glory.</p>

Had not Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt ſhed his blood, no ſinner had ever taſted of this life eternal. Eternal life is the free gift of God, and yet it is merited by Chriſt.

            <p n="2">2. <hi>He is our life efficaciouſly.</hi> Though ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be purchaſed for the Elect, yet muſt the Elect of God be fitted and prepared for this ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation before they can be put into the poſſeſſion of it.

He doth by his Spirit change their nature, he doth by his grace renew the ſpirit of their minde; he doth ſet up his own image in their ſoules, and by working grace, fit them for the enjoyment of that life of glory which he hath purchaſed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>He is our life.</hi> He is the fountaine of our eternal glory, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 11. <hi>This is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Sonne.</hi> 'Tis in him as in the head, as in the root, as in the fountain, or ſpring: All our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is laid up in Jeſus Chriſt, as in a publick trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury.

            <p n="4">4. <hi>Jeſus Christ is our life in regard of prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> As he doth prepare us for heaven, ſo doth he prepare heaven for us. This is attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

'Tis by way of alluſion to the practices of great Kings, who ſend their harbingers before them, to make ready for them againſt their coming. Ieſus Chriſt is pleaſed to ſtile himſelf ſo in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Elect. And therefore the Apoſtle calls him our forerunner, <gap reason="foreign">

The affirming of Chriſt is the denial of works, and the affirming of works is the denial of Chriſt. <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 11, 12. <hi>This is the ſtone which was ſet at nought of you builders, &amp;c.</hi> neither is <hi>ſalvation in any other: for there is no other name given under heaven, &amp;c.</hi> And the truth is, all the things required to make a work meritorious are wanting in the beſt of our good works.

Uſe 3. <hi>Let this provoke all men to get an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest in Chriſt.</hi> There's nothing but eternal death without him. <hi>He that hath the Sonne hath life; he that hath not the Sonne hath not life, but the wrath of God abideth on him,</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 12.

            <p n="2">II. <hi>The ends of Chriſts appearing are</hi> ſuch as theſe. 1. <hi>To declare that ſin is aboliſhed.</hi> This is the meaning of that, <hi>Heb</hi> 9. 28. 2. <hi>That he may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired in his Saints, &amp;c.</hi> This end of his coming the

Apoſtle ſets down, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 10. he ſhall come <hi>to be glorified in his Saints, and to be admired in all them that beleev.</hi> One end of the ſecond coming of Ieſus Chriſt, is to communicate his glory to his Saints that have beleeved in him. He ſhall put his glory upon them, and ſo ſhall be glorified in them. Ieſus Chriſt is glorified in his Saints now, That holineſſe and grace which he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to them already doth render them very glorious: but at his ſecond coming his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry will ſhine in them with greater ſplendor then now it doth. He will then communicate unto them all his glory, and make them glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as he is glorious. Our Saviour mentions this, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 3. <hi>I will come again, and receive you unto my ſelf.</hi> He comes to fetch all his Elect to heaven, and to reveale his glory both to their ſoules and bodies. He ſhall then actually put ſoule and body into the full poſſeſſion of that glorious redemption which he hath purchaſed for them. <hi>'Tis called the day of redemption,</hi> Luke 21. 28.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>To execute the ſentence of his wrath upon all his enemies, and the enemies of his people.</hi> Ieſus Chriſt hath ſeverely threatned all wicked men, that he will viſibly take vengeance on them for the diſhonours they have done to him, and the wrongs they have done to his people; And in this ſecond manifeſtation of himſelf, he will put all thoſe threatnings into execution. Of this the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 7, 8, 9. <hi>The Lord Ieſus ſhall be revealed from heaven in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, &amp;c.</hi> And of this, <hi>Enoch</hi> prophecyed long ago, <hi>Iude</hi> 15. <hi>Behold the Lord cometh with ten thouſands of his Saints, to execute judgement on all, &amp;c.</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:38484:24"/>
Wicked men are now ſecure, they reproach God and wrong his people; but Ieſus Chriſt will one day viſibly come from heaven to puniſh theſe contempts and injuries. The evil Angels, and ſinful men ſhall then be publickly adjudged to ſuffer that torment which they have deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To put an end to his Churches ſufferings. Rev. 20. 10. <hi>Then ſhall the devil that deceived the world be caſt into the lake of fire and brimſtone, where the beaſt and the falſe Prophet are, and ſhall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>To gather together his Elect.</hi> This the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt ſets down, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 30. 31. They ſhall ſee the Sonne of man coming in the clouds. And he ſhall ſend his Angels, and they ſhall ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther together his Elect from the four winds, &amp;c. The Elect of God are ſcattered up and down in the ſeveral quarters of the world, ſcarce two or three of them are now together in one family at the ſame time; but then they ſhall be collected, never to part aſunder to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p n="3">III. What manner of appearing this ſhall be. Conſider for that theſe four things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>It ſhall be a real and corporal appearance.</hi> Chriſt ſhall not appear imaginarily, as ſome have thought, nor ſhall he only appear accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Divine nature, but he ſhall appeare bodily and truly: the ſame humane nature which was in the grave, and afterwards aſcended into heaven, ſhall deſcend from heaven. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 30. <hi>Then ſhall appeare the ſigne of the Sonne of man.</hi> The humanity ſhall appear; ſo the Angels tell the Diſciples at his Aſcenſion, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 11. <hi>This</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:38484:24"/>
               <hi>ſame Jeſus which is taken into heaven, ſhall ſo come in like manner as ye have ſeen him go into heaven.</hi> As he did really and bodily aſcend, ſo ſhall he really and corporally deſcend. God will honour the humane nature of Chriſt in the world. They ſhall look upon him whom they have pierced. The ſame fleſh of Chriſt which was pierced, ſhall be manifeſted in his ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It ſhall be a ſudden appearing.</hi> His coming is compared to a ſudden flaſh of lightning, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 27. The appearance of Chriſt is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the lightning, in two reſpects. 1. <hi>For the evidence of it.</hi> It ſhall be as clear to the eyes of men as the lightning is. 2. <hi>For the ſuddenneſſe of it.</hi> A flaſh of lightning doth ſuddenly break forth, and in an inſtant ſhines from one end of the heaven to another; ſo ſhall the appearance of Chriſt be. And for this very cauſe is it compared to the coming of a thiefe in the night, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 39, 40. <hi>As it was in the dayes of Noah, ſo ſhall it be when the Son of man cometh, They ate, they drank, &amp;c.</hi> Mat. 24. 37. when men ſay, peace, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>It ſhall be a very glorious appearance.</hi> He ſhall come with power and great glory, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 30. He was not ſo mean and deſpicable in his firſt coming, as he ſhall be majeſtical, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned in this his ſecond coming. His firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance was in the form of a ſervant. He came not to be miniſtred unto, but to miniſter. A low kinde of appearance was moſt fit for ſuch work; but when he appeares again, he ſhall come as a Judge, as King of kings, and Lord of lords; therefore Majeſty is fit for him. The Scripture doth ſet out the glory of his coming ſundry
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:38484:25"/>
wayes. 1. He ſhall come in the <hi>clouds of heaven.</hi> The bright cloud ſhall be his chariot, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 30. 2. He ſhall come attended with an innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable company <hi>of glorious Angels.</hi> Thoſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſpirits ſhall come in full regiments attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon his perſon to do him ſervice, and to execute his will, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 31. He had the beaſts to attend on him at his firſt coming; but he ſhall have Angels to wait upon him at this coming. 3. He ſhall come with the voice of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angel, with a mighty ſhout, and with the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet of God, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 16. All theſe expreſſions are uſed to ſet out the glory of it. All outward glory which ever man beheld, is but darkneſſe in this reſpect.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>It ſhall be a very dreadful and terrible ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.</hi> Full of Majeſty, and therefore full of terror. His firſt coming was dreadful, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 5. The Scripture ſets out the dreadfulneſſe of it by the Antecedents, Concomitants, Conſequents of it. The Antecedents are in <hi>Matthew</hi> 24. 29. ſuch an alteration ſhall be made upon the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures being, that Sunne, Moon and Starres being obſcured by the glory of Chriſt, ſhall ceaſe from their ſervice, and not be able to ſhew their glory as before. The Concomitants, the firing of the world. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of this, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 10. what a dreadful ſight will this be to the wicked. The conſequents of it are, the raiſing of the dead, the ſetting up of the Thrones, the ſummoning of all the world to judgement. Well doth the Scripture call it the terrible day of the Lord.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>When ſhall this appearing be?</hi> you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imagine that I ſhould be ſo bold as to ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing of the particular day, moneth, or yeare
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:38484:25"/>
of Chriſts coming. Our Saviour hath for ever ſilenced all curious enquirers about it, <hi>Mar.</hi> 13. 32. The Scripture tells us thus much about the time of it, that it ſhall be when the time of the Churches tribulation is ended. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 29. When the number of Gods elect is converted. In the end oft dayes, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 13. It is one of thoſe <hi>Noviſſima,</hi> or laſt things, which is to be expected in the world.</p>
            <p n="5">V. <hi>Why is it deferred?</hi> 1. <hi>Becauſe the Elect of God are not yet called.</hi> All the Veſſels of glory are not borne into the world. Chriſt ſtayes till theſe flowers be ſprung up. The fetching of theſe to heaven is one end of his coming; And he will not come till theſe are brought forth. As the world was made at firſt, ſo doth it ſtand and continue for their ſakes. 2. <hi>That ſpace and time for repentance may be afforded unto ſinful men.</hi> This reaſon the Apoſtle renders of it, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>The Lord is not ſlack, &amp;c. but is long ſuffering to us-ward, not willing that any ſhould pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance.</hi> He defers his coming, that ſinners may have more tenders of ſalvation made to them; that ſo they may be inexcuſable, if they do not returne. 3. <hi>That the faith, hope, patience of his own chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren may be exerciſed.</hi> The delaying of Chriſts coming is a very great help both to exerciſe faith, watchfulneſſe and patience. We may ſay of this, as the Prophet doth of the delaying of another day of the Lord, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>Though it tarry, wait for it, becauſe it will ſurely come, it will not tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> And <hi>the juſt ſhall live by his faith.</hi> 4. <hi>That all other of Gods decrees for, and about the things which muſt come to paſſe before this day, may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed.</hi> Many things God hath decreed
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:38484:26"/>
ſhall be done before his appearance, which are not yet done in the world. The preaching of the Goſpel to all Nations, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 14. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrowing of Antichriſt, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 3, 8. The making of the Jewes and Gentiles into one Church, &amp;c. Chriſt ſtayes, becauſe theſe decrees muſt be accompliſhed.</p>

               <head>The Uſes of this Point.</head>
               <p>Uſe 1. <hi>Away with thoſe Atheiſts, and Epicures who deny this Doctrine.</hi> In the very dayes of the Apoſtles, there were ſome ſcoffers that did mock at this doctrine of Chriſts appearing, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 3, 4. <hi>where is the promiſe of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</hi> we have many ſuch ſcoffers in our dayes, that deride the Doctrine of the reſurrection of eternal life, of Chriſts ſecond coming. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle tells us the reaſon of this ſcoffing in the ſame place. 1. <hi>The impurity of their hearts.</hi> They walk after their own <hi>luſts.</hi> That's one great ground of Atheiſtical and wicked opinions. Such Doctrines curb and check their luſts, and becauſe they cannot have their luſts by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſuch doctrines, they therefore reject and ſcoffe at ſuch doctrines. 2. <hi>They walk more by ſenſe, then by the teſtimony of the Word of God.</hi> Since the fathers fell aſleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the Creation; becauſe they cannot apprehend with their ſenſe any ſuch doctrine, or any ground of it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they reject it. Such as theſe who will not be convinced by Scripture, we ſhall leave to feel the ſeverity of that coming, which they will not beleeve. They that now ſcoffe, will have time
<pb facs="tcp:38484:26"/>
enough ſadly to bewaile their ſcoffing, they ſhall then feele what they will not now be perſwaded to beleeve.</p>
               <p>Uſe 2. <hi>The deare love of Jeſus Chriſt to his people.</hi> As his departure was a rich teſtimony of his love; <hi>'Tis expedient for you that I go away,</hi> ſo is his returning; <hi>I will not leave you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſſe, I will come unto you,</hi> Joh. 14. 18. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver think of Chriſts returning, but meditate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the greatneſſe of his love.</p>
               <p>Uſe 3. <hi>That Christ is not now corporally in the world.</hi> The Scripture ſpeaks of his corporal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance as of a future thing. The Papiſts they make him corporally preſent in the Sacrament. His body ſhall deſcend but once, and that ſhall never be till he come to take his people into glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with himſelf. The doctrine of the real cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral preſence of Chriſt is a doctrine of real falſhood.</p>
               <p>Uſe 4. <hi>This is a very ſad doctrine to all ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſinners.</hi> Chriſt ſhall appear. It were well for wicked men, if this Doctrine were an untruth. The very end of his appearing is to bring you to a publick tryal for all your acts of High-trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt his Crown and dignity. He will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, and then you ſhall appeare before him to render an account of, and to ſuffer puniſhment for all your hard words and cruel actings againſt him, and againſt his in the world; when he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares you ſhall wiſh that the mountaines might fall upon you to hide you from his ſight. The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Chriſt to you, will be as the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a ſevere Judge to a convicted male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor. Conſider of it before-hand, that by time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and thorough repentance, you may prevent that dreadful ſentence which will be denounced
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:38484:27"/>
and executed upon the wicked in that day. <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix</hi> trembled when he heard this doctrine. <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 25. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>My fleſh.</hi> Fleſh, when it is ſpoken in relation to Chriſt, as here in the Text, ſignifies two things. 1. Sometimes the manhood alone. So you have it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 63. <hi>It is the ſpirit that quickneth, the fleſh profiteth nothing.</hi> In this place the fleſh ſignifies onely the humanity of Chriſt. So <hi>Auſtin</hi> expounds it, and <hi>Calvin</hi> after him. The huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is without advantage if it be ſeparated from the ſpirit, that is, <hi>à ſpiritus virtute, quâ perfuſa est caro. Calvin.</hi> 'Tis the Divinity that gives efficacy to the humanity. It is from the Spirit that the fleſh hath any feeding vertue. 2. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the whole perſon of Chriſt, God-man. And ſo it is to be underſtood in the Text. <hi>My fleſh is meat,</hi> that is, <hi>I am meat.</hi> I, God and man in one perſon. Now why fleſh is mentioned here,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:38484:28"/>
                  <hi>Cameron</hi> gives the reaſon; becauſe our life is in the fleſh and blood of Chriſt. <hi>Si enim carnem &amp; ſanguinem Chriſto tollas, non erit amplius ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus noster.</hi> For that he might be food for our ſoules, it was neceſſary that he ſhould ſatisfie the juſtice of God, and ſo purchaſe for us remiſſion of ſinnes. Therefore becauſe by the ſhedding of his blood, and by the ſacrificing and offering up of his body upon the croſſe, he purchaſed this for us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 22. his fleſh is ſaid to be our meat, and his blood our drink.</p>
               <p>

                  </gap>, the fleſh of Chriſt is called meat indeed, in a twofold reſpect.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) <hi>In reſpect of all other food.</hi> All other food in reſpect of this, is but <hi>cibi tantummodo umbra &amp; vana imago,</hi> as <hi>Cameron</hi> ſaith. As natural life in reſpect of the ſpiritual, is but a ſhadow of life; ſo the meat that is appointed for the natural life, if compared with the meat of the Spiritual life, is but a very image of meat. Chriſts fleſh is real meat.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) In reſpect of that typical meat which the Jews had lately ſpoken of, <hi>v.</hi> 31. <hi>Our fathers</hi>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:38484:29"/>
                  <hi>did eat Manna in the deſart, &amp;c.</hi> Our Saviour tells them that that is but typical bread, but his fleſh is bread indeed; it is the real ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of which that was but a meere type and ſhadow. Thus for Explication. The Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is this.</p>
               <p>Doct 1. <hi>That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is really and truly the food and meat of beleevers.</hi> Fleſh is here put for the whole perſon of Chriſt. Jeſus Chriſt as he is held out in the Scriptures, is the true, real, and very meat of beleeving Chriſtians; Chriſt as he is propounded in the Goſpel, dead, broken, crucified. Chriſt in all his perfection, compleatneſſe, fulneſſe, is <hi>meat indeed</hi> to a true beleever. 'Tis the very ſcope of this Sermon, from <hi>v.</hi> 27. to <hi>v.</hi> 59. in which this truth is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated over and over againe, and all objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons anſwered, which the carnal reaſon, and unbeleefe of mans heart can make againſt it.</p>
               <p>I ſhall in the Explication of this Doctrine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen theſe things. 1. Prove that Chriſt is a beleevers meat. 2. Shew the Analogy between Chriſt and other meat. 3. How this meat is eaten and received.</p>
               <p n="1">I. That Chriſt is the ſoules meat. This is proved two wayes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>from the types of Chriſt in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament.</hi> The Ceremonial Law had many types of Chriſt. Whatſoever is revealed of Chriſt in the New Teſtament, was ſome way or other typified of him in the Ceremonial Law. There are foure types which did ſet out Jeſus Chriſt as the ſouls meat.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Manna in the wilderneſſe.</hi> The Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Manna is ſet down, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:38484:29"/>
people being in ſome want of proviſion in the Wilderneſſe of ſinne began to murmur againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron, v.</hi> 3. God promiſeth, <hi>v.</hi> 4. to raine bread from heaven for them, which accordingly was done, <hi>v.</hi> 14, 15. That this was a type of the feeding vertue of Chriſt, is plainly diſcovered by our Saviour in this very Sermon, <hi>v.</hi> 31, 32. The Wilderneſſe did typifie the ſtate of the Church in this world, and the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na was a plaine type of Chriſt the Churches meat.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Shewbread,</hi> The Law and manner of the Shewbread you have at large, <hi>Lev.</hi> 24. 5, 6, 7. 8, 9. There are two things repreſented by this Shewbread. Firſt, the multitude of the faithful preſented unto God in his Church, as upon a pure table, continually ſerving him<hi>:</hi> made by faith and holineſſe, as fine cakes; and by the mediation of Chriſt, as by incenſe, made a ſweet odour unto God. Secondly, the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual repaſt which the Church hath from and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, who feedeth them with Chriſt the bread of life.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The meat-offerings.</hi> Concerning this Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chah or meat-offering you may reade at large, <hi>Lev.</hi> 2. 1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe meat-offerings were of two ſorts; ſome were the meat-offerings of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, ſome of particular perſons; of theſe latter there were ſeveral ſorts mentioned in that Chapter. It's ſaid, <hi>v.</hi> 3. that <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſons ſhall have the remnant of the meat-offering, that is, all of it; but that which is burned upon the Altar for a memorial, <hi>v.</hi> 2. Several things were ſignified by the meat-offerings. Being referred to Chriſt (who by the oblation of his own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, was our meat offering, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. 6. <hi>Heb.</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:38484:30"/>
10. 5.) they did ſhadow out our communion with Chriſt, and participation of his death, and reſurrection by faith, whereby he becomes unto us ſpiritual meat, of which the whole Church are made partakers.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The fleſh of the ſacrifices of the peace-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> and others which were given to the Prieſts, of which you read, <hi>Lev.</hi> 7. 15. they were to be eaten the ſame day it was killed. Now what was meant by the eating of the fleſh of theſe ſacrifices, and of the fleſh of the other ſacrifices which were given to the Prieſts to eat, <hi>vid. Lev.</hi> 10. 12, 13, 14. Surely Jeſus Chriſt, who by his fleſh as by precious meat, feedeth his people who are ſpirituall, Prieſts unto everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>from the Sacraments of nouriſhment both of the Old and New Teſtament.</hi> There were Sacraments of implantation, or initiation, and of growth; under the Law, Circumciſion Paſſeover; under the Goſpel, Baptiſme, Supper of the Lord.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Sacrament of nouriſhment under the Old Teſtament, was the Paſchal lamb. The Law and rites of this are ſet down, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 3, 4, 5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What did this Paſchal Lamb ſignifie, but Jeſus Chriſt our Paſſeover, the Lamb of God which taketh away the ſinnes of the world? In this Sacrament was Jeſus Chriſt ſet out as a nouriſher. He is that precious meat upon which all the true Iſrael of God feed continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who is therefore called our Paſſeover, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 7.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Lords Supper.</hi> This is the Sacrament of nouriſhment under the New Teſtament. And herein clearly Chriſt is exhibited as our
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:38484:30"/>
ſpiritual meat. His fleſh is the bread, the wine is his blood. As the body is nouriſhed by bread and wine, ſo is the ſoule by his body and blood nouriſhed and fed to life eternal.</p>
               <p>II. The Analogy between Chriſt and corporal meat, ſtands in theſe three particulars. Three great ends of meat.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Corporal meat is for the preſervation of the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Suſienta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> 
                  <hi>natural life.</hi> The natural life is maintained by meat, through the concurrence of Gods ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bleſſing. 'Tis <hi>pabulum vitae.</hi> Hence bread, under which all other proviſion is comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is called the <hi>ſtaffe of life,</hi> Eſay 3. 1. Keep the ſtrongeſt man from meat but a few dayes, and the life will extinguiſh and go out, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 12. Jeſus Chriſt is the maintainer and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver of the ſpiritual life. As he gives it at firſt, ſo he upholds it. 'Tis by continual influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences from him, that the life is kept from expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. If he withdraw his influx never ſo little, the ſoule is at the giving up of the Ghoſt, even halfe dead.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Corporal meat is for growth.</hi> 'Tis by meat <note place="margin">Vegetation</note> that the body is brought from infancy to child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, from childhood to youth, from youth to a perfect man. Jeſus Chriſt is he that carries on a Chriſtian from infancy to perfection. All the ſoules growth and increaſe is from Chriſt. So the Apoſtle, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 19. <hi>From him the whole body having nouriſhment miniſtred, &amp;c.</hi> The branches live and increaſe by vertue of the ſap which is derived from the root. Chriſtians grow by vertue of the ſap which is to them derived from Jeſus Chriſt. Every part growes by Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Meat is a repayer of natures decayes.</hi> When <note place="margin">Reparation</note> by ſome violent ſickneſſe the ſpirits are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:38484:31"/>
the body waſted, the ſtrength loſt, meat fitly and ſeaſonably taken, helps through the divine bleſſing to recover all again; 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 12. his ſpirit came to him againe. Jeſus Chriſt is the repairer of the ſoules decayes. Sometimes a beleever through the neglect of his duty, through ſurfetting upon ſinne, brings ſpiritual languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings upon himſelf, his ſtrength is decayed, his vigour is abated, his pulſe beats very weakly, he can ſcarcely creep in the wayes of God. In ſuch a caſe Jeſus Chriſt recovers him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paires his breaches and renues his ſtrength, as in former times. The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaks of this, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23. 3. <hi>He restoreth my ſoul, He leadeth me in the paths of righteouſneſſe for his Names ſake.</hi> The Saints have every day experience of this reſtoring vertue of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">III. How this meat is eaten and received. The Scripture makes mention of three things which concur to this act.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Ordinances.</hi> Theſe are the conduits. Jeſus Chriſt hath inſtituted and appointed his Ordinances to be the meanes of carrying his nouriſhing vertue to the ſoul. The Ordinances are the diſhes of gold upon which this heavenly meat is brought. Prayer, Reading, Preaching, Meditation, holy conference, the Sacrament; in theſe Chriſt preſents himſelf to the ſoul. He that forſakes theſe, can expect no feeding from Chriſt. <hi>In this mountaine will the Lord of Hoſts make a feaſt of fat things, &amp;c.</hi> Eſay 25. 6. The feaſt is made in the mountain of Gods houſe, and the Ordinances are the diſhes on which this meat is ſet, and the knives by which its carved out to the ſoul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Saving lively faith.</hi> This is the inſtrument.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:38484:31"/>
What the hand, and mouth, and ſtomack are in the corporal eating, that is faith in this ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al eating. Faith is the <hi>hand</hi> that takes this meat, the <hi>mouth</hi> that eats it, and the <hi>ſtomack</hi> that digeſts it. Yea, faith is as the veines and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries that do diſperſe and carry this nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to every power of the ſoule. This is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly cleared in this very Chapter, <hi>v.</hi> 35. he that cometh to me ſhall never hunger, he that beleeveth in me ſhall never thirſt. <hi>Cometh</hi> is expounded by <hi>beleeveth.</hi> Eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are here put for believing. <hi>Crede &amp; mandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſti.</hi> He that beleeves eats; and he that eats not, it is becauſe he beleeves not; <hi>Hic ed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>re eſt credere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Doct. 2. <hi>That the blood of Jeſus Chriſt is drink indeed.</hi> Blood is here put for the whole perſon, as fleſh was. And its rather <hi>his blood</hi> is drink, then that <hi>He</hi> is drink; becauſe the great efficacy of all Chriſt did, lies principally in his blood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9, 22. And in the ſame reſpects, as his fleſh is ſaid to be meat <hi>indeed,</hi> his blood is ſaid to be drink <hi>indeed.</hi> And thoſe three things which concurre to the act of eating his fleſh, concur alſo to this act of drinking his blood. The myſtical union, ſaving faith, the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. I ſhall therefore onely open two things,
<list>
                     <item>1. Shew that Chriſts blood is drink.</item>
                     <item>2. The Analogy between his blood and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther drink.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. That the blood of Chriſt is ſpiritual drink, will appear.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>From the drink-offerings under the Law.</hi> In the Law there were ſundry drink-offerings ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed as well as meat-offerings. The daily ſacrifice which was to be offered continually, every morning and evening, had both a meat-offering,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:38484:32"/>
and drink annexed to it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 40, 41. The daily ſacrifice did ſignifie three things.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) That Jeſus Chriſt the true Lamb of God was available to the Church of God, from the morning of the world, to the evening, the end of the world.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) To ſignifie the continual need the Church had of reconciliation by Chriſts blood, which taketh away ſinne.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) To ſanctifie the morning and evening prayers of the Church, by the interceding ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of Chriſt the Mediator. And the meat-offering, and drink-offering added thereunto, did ſignifie, that Jeſus Chriſt by offering himſelf to God, becomes not onely our redemption, but alſo meat and drink to the ſoul. The ſheaf of the firſt fruits appointed to be offered every year, had both the meat-offering and drink-offering added thereunto, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 10, 11, 12, 13. The like is to be obſerved in other ſacrifices. Now as the meat-offerings <note place="margin">Numb. 15 init.</note> did repreſent Chriſt as food, ſo the drink-offerings did ſet him out as our ſpiritual drink.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>From the water iſſuing out of the rock.</hi> You read the ſtory of that, <hi>Numb.</hi> 20. The people in the deſart of <hi>Zin</hi> wanted water. In their neceſſity, as their ſinful cuſtom was, they fall a murmuring, <hi>v.</hi> 3, 4, 5. God commands <hi>Moſes,</hi> v. 8. to ſpeak unto the rock to give them water; that they and their cattel might drink. <hi>Moſes ſmites</hi> the rock twice (which was his ſinne, becauſe God only commanded him to <hi>ſpeak</hi> to the rock) and it gave forth its water in abundance, <hi>v.</hi> 11. Now what the meaning of this water was, the Apoſtle tells us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. <hi>They drank of the rock that followed them, and</hi>

                  <hi>that rock was Chriſt. The rock typiſied Chriſt,</hi> and the water of the rock, of which they and their cattel drank, typed out the blood of Chriſt our ſpiritual drink.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>From the cup in the Lords Supper.</hi> Why is the cup added to the bread? Is it not to let us know, that Jeſus Chriſt is ſpiritual drink as well as our ſpiritual bread?</p>

               <p n="2">II. <hi>Quae Analogia?</hi> The Analogy ſtands in foure things. There are four properties of drink diſtinct from meat.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Drink is for refreſhing and cooling.</hi> When the body is hot by labour, or by ſickneſſe, or travel, drink doth coole and refreſh it. <hi>The heart panteth after the water-brooks,</hi> Pſalm. 42. 1. The chaſed Hart when he is heated with hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, makes to the river, and by drinking is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed. The ſweating Traveller goes to the ſpring and cooles himſelfe by drinking of the ſtreaming waters. The blood of Jeſus Chriſt is of a very refreſhing and cooling nature. When the ſoul is heated with temptations, parched with the fiery wrath of God in the conſcience, when it lies ſweating and ſweltring under guilt,

                  </gap>, nothing indeed can coole the parched ſoule but Chriſts blood. And this will do it abundantly when 'tis quite melted with wrath, and burnt up with anguiſh.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Drink cleanſeth the body.</hi> The inward parts are waſhed and purified as well as refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. As the running water cleanſeth the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, and carries away rubbiſh and filth, ſo drink ſeaſonably and fitly taken, carries away the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filements that are contracted within the body. The blood of Chriſt is of a cleanſing nature. 'Tis indeed the only cleanſer. It doth, being taken by faith, carry away all the filthineſſe of the inward Man. All the Ceremonial purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were types of the purifying blood of Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 13, 14. There ye have the typical clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings expounded. <hi>The blood of Jeſus Chriſt cleanſeth us from all ſinne,</hi> 1 John 1. 7 Chriſt takes away the guilt of ſinne by juſtification, and he cleanſeth us from the filthineſſe of ſinne by ſanctification.

The blood of Jeſus Chriſt is a reviving blood. When the ſoul is in <hi>deliquio ſpirituali,</hi> when it faints, and dies, and ſinks, the ſprinklings of this blood will fetch it again, a drop or two of this true <hi>Aqua-vitae</hi> taken down by faith, will open the eyes and reſtore it again. This effect it had on <hi>Aſaph,</hi> Pſ. 73. 26. <hi>My heart and my fleſh faileth, &amp;c. but thou art the ſtay of my heart, and my portion for ever.</hi> This was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told of Chriſt long before his birth, by that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical Prophet, <hi>Eſay</hi> 61. 1. and <hi>chap.</hi> 57. 15. <hi>To revive the ſpirit of the humble, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive the heart of the contrite ones.</hi> It is his blood, and that alone, that healeth the broken in heart.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Drink is of a cheering nature.</hi> It doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get and continue cheerfulneſſe. The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> tells us that <hi>wine maketh glad the heart of man, Pſalme</hi> 104. 15. The blood of Chriſt is a heart-chearing thing.

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Behold here the fulneſſe of Chriſt.</hi> Whence ſhall we have bread in the Wilderneſſe to ſatisfie ſo many, ſay the Diſciples to Chriſt, <hi>Mar.</hi> 8. 4, 5. The fulneſſe of Chriſt appears in this, that he hath enough in him to feed ſo many, and to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:38484:34"/>
feed every one ſo plentifully. He hath ſed his people ever ſince that promiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. and he will feed all his Elect to the end of the world, and he will feed them all abundantly every kind of way; he feeds them with grace, feeds them with knowledge, feeds them in reſpect of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and he feeds them in reſpect of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, &amp;c. and yet is there no abatement of his fulneſſe. <hi>Did not the fulneſſe of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head dwell bodily in him?</hi> Col. 2. 9. he could not feed ſo many ſo long every way, without any diminution of his fulneſſe; the children have been eating above five thouſand years, and the loaf is ſtill whole.</p>

He could not have been our meat and drink, if he had not been ſacrificed; the Prieſts were not to eat of the offerings allowed them till they were ſacrificed, had not Chriſt been ſacrificed, he could have been no food for us.

IV. <hi>Behold here the compleatneſſe of Chriſt.</hi> The Scripture ſpeaks much of his compleatneſs and perfection. Look upon him in what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, under what notion you pleaſe, and you will ſee his compleatneſſe. Behold him as a Saviour, and ſo he is a compleat; he ſaves <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7 25. he ſaves the ſoul, the body from all evil, unto all good, and that for ever. Conſider him as a <hi>Phyſician,</hi> and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatneſſe will appeare. He heales the ſoule, the body, heales in an inſtant, heales to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, &amp;c. whatſoever he is compared to, he is compleatly and perfectly ſo. Behold him as a <hi>Feeder,</hi> and he is compleat in that notion; He is not onely meat nor onely drink, but he is both meat and drink, compleat nouriſhment. The body cannot live with meat, if drink be wanting; nor can it ſubſiſt by drink onely without meat. Bread without drink would dry up the blood; drink without meat would in a little time drown the body. A mixture, and fit proportion of both keeps it in health. Jeſus Chriſt is both theſe, compleat and perfect nouriſhment. Well may the Apoſtle ſay, that Chriſtians are compleat in him, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 10. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. He is in himſelfe every way compleat, and thoſe that adhere to him, are perfectly compleat in him.</p>
               <p n="5">V: <hi>Take notice of the truth of Christ humanity. Marcion, Eutiches, Saturnius, Maniches</hi> hold that Chriſt was man onely in appearance. The Scripture doth both aſſert the God-head and Man-hood of Chriſt. The two natures are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally united, never to be ſeparated. His Name ſhall be called <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> Mat. 1. 23. And the truth of the Man-hood is aſſerted in many

places. <hi>The Word became fleſh, and dwelt among us,</hi> Joh. 1. 14. <hi>To us a childe is born,</hi> Eſay 9. 6. As other Scriptures, ſo the Text doth clearly aſſert his humanity, for it makes mention of his fleſh and blood. The God-head hath neither fleſh nor blood, but the Man-hood hath both. He is perfect God, and perfect man of a reaſonable ſoule, and humane fleſh ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. <hi>How injurious are the Papiſts to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, that deny them his blood.</hi> They take away from the Laity (as they call them) the blood of Chriſt in the Sacrament.

               <p n="2">(2) <hi>This doctrine is prejudicial to the ſoule.</hi> It is indeed a ſoul-ſtarving doctrine. Our works cannot feed us. The Prophet tells us, <hi>Eſay</hi> 44. 20. that the Idolater feedeth on aſhes. Our beſt works and duties are not meat and drink, but aſhes. 'Tis as impoſſible that the body ſhould live upon aſhes, or other ſuch traſh, as that the ſoule ſhould live upon its own works. Our works have no nouriſhing vertue in them. <hi>If a Sonne ſhall ask bread,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, of any of you that is a father, <hi>will he give him a ſtone?</hi> Luke 11. 11, 12. The Papiſts are unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral fathers to their children. When they ask them bread, they give them a ſtone; when they ask fiſh, they give them a ſerpent; and when they ask an egge, they give them a ſcorpion. A mans beſt works are Stones, Serpents, Scorpions; yea, they are poyſon to him that makes them his food.

               <p n="11">XI. <hi>Behold here the excellency of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> He is meat and drink. He is indeed compared to all things that are excellent; he doth farre excel whatſoever he is compared unto. He is as far above all other meat and drink, as the beſt meat and drink are above the courſeſt pulſe, and the muddieſt water. See this excellency in a few particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Chriſt is ſpiritual meat and drink.</hi> All other meat and drink is onely corporeal. 'Tis ſo in its own nature, and 'tis ſo in regard of the ſubject; it nouriſheth not the ſoule, but the body onely. All their delicacies do not feed the inward man. Thoſe that have the fatteſt bodies, have not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the fatteſt ſoules. But Chriſt is ſpiritual meat and drink.

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Chriſt is incorruptible meat and drink.</hi> All earthly meat and drink is of a fading periſhing na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The beſt bread grows mouldy in a little time, the beſt fleſh in time putrifies and taints; the beſt wine growes eager and ſowre in a little time, and becomes unfit for the body of man. The very Manna it ſelf, when it was kept till the morning of the next day, contrary to Gods command, bred wormes and ſtandk, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 20. But Jeſus Chriſt knows no corruption. His fleſh &amp; blood is now as ſweet and pleaſant after ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ages, as it was the firſt houre it was eaten and drank, <hi>John</hi> 6. 27. And it will be as farre from corruption at the end of the world, as now it is. The Manna in the golden pot corrupted not, though kept for many Generations.

All that Generation that fed on Manna, and drank the water out of the rock, died, <hi>John</hi> 6. 49. But Chriſt preſerves the ſoul from Death. <hi>John</hi> 6. 50. <hi>This is the bread of God that came down from Heaven, that a man may eat thereof and not die.</hi> It immortalizes the ſoule that feeds on it. <hi>He that beleeveth on me hath eternal life,</hi> ver. 51.

5. <hi>Chriſt is ſoul-ſatisfying meat and drink. He that beleeveth on me ſhall never hunger, and he that cometh to me ſhall never thirſt,</hi> John 6. 35. There is a <hi>hunger of deſire,</hi> and a <hi>hunger and thirſt of total emptineſſe and want.</hi> He that hath this meat and drink, ſhall never totally want him. It is not ſo with other meat and drink. A man may have his belly filled with other meat and drink, and may have a good quantity before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, and yet may at laſt want a morſel and die for want of a draught of water. But he that once hath this ſpiritual meat and drink, though he eat but a little, ſhall never be utterly deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, <hi>Jehn</hi> 7. 37, 38. The widows handful of meal, and ſpoonful of oyle, was never ſpent till God ſent raine upon the earth, 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 17. 16. He that hath but a handful of Chriſts fleſh, and a ſpoonful of his blood ſhall never ſee want, but ſhall have enough to ſatisfie him to all eternity.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Chriſt is ſuch meat and drink as gives life to the Dead.</hi> Other meat and drink cannot preſerve a living body from death, much leſſe can it give life, and reſtore breath to a dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Put the moſt delicate meat, the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt drink into the mouth of a dead man, and they will not give him life if the ſoul be quite depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. They may recover from a ſwoon, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not from death. But the fleſh and blood of Chriſt quicken the dead. Chriſt by putting his fleſh and blood into the mouth of the dead ſoul conveys life into it. His fleſh and blood make the lips of the dead to ſpeak. As the Father raiſeth the dead and quickneth them, ſo the Son quickneth whom he will, <hi>John</hi> 5. 21. if thou haſt
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:38484:38"/>
any ſpiritual life in thee, thou didſt receive it from the enlivening vertue of Chriſts fleſh and blood communicated to thee by the Spirit of life.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Chriſt is ſuch meat and drink as will never ſurſet.</hi> All other meat and drink, if it be taken immoderately and unſeaſonably, tends to ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Hence is <hi>Solomons</hi> advice, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25. 16. drunkenneſſe and ſurfeting bring more to their long home, then pining famine. But the fleſh and blood of Chriſt never ſurfet. A man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eat and drink too much of Chriſt, nor can they eat and drink him unſeaſonably. There is no killing, no annoying vertue in Jeſus Chriſt: this meat and drink will never clog, never cloy the ſtomack. Chriſt is an occaſion of death to none but to thoſe that refuſe him.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>Chriſt is ſuch meat and drink as is ſuitable for all perſons at all times.</hi> Other meat and drink is not fit for all perſons, nor for the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in all conditions. That that will nouriſh a man may kill a childe. That that ſtrengthens a man in health, may kill him in ſickneſſe. There is meat for ſtrong men, milk for babes, &amp;c. But Jeſus Chriſt is meat and drink for all perſons, for all conditions. He is meat for the ſtrong man, he is milk for the babe. He is proper for the healthful perſon, and he is fit for the ſickly perſon. He is the labouring mans food, and he is the ſick mans diet. His blood is Phyſical drink to him that is ſick; cooling drink to him that is parched with heat, he is ſtrong cordial-drink to him that faints. He is a ſuitable nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

9. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is meat and drink that is freely beſtowed.</hi> He is not purchaſed by our money, nor procured by our induſtry, but freely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated. Other meat and drink is procured at dear rates. Men muſt Till, and Plow, and Sowe their land; men muſt breed up cattel, men muſt plant vines, dig ſprings and fountaines, otherwiſe they can expect neither meat nor drink. The <hi>Egyptians</hi> in a time of famine pawn'd their lands for food, they gave their cattel for bread, and at laſt ſold their land out-right that they might have food, <hi>Gen.</hi> 47. 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. But Chriſt is meat and drink, though the moſt coſtly in himſelfe, yet coſtleſſe to us. Nothing is required on our part, but receiving of him. If any ſhould offer money, Chriſt would ſay as <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> Act. 8. 20. <hi>Thy money periſh with thee.</hi> He that will not take this meat and drink as an Alms, ſhall famiſh for want of it.</p>

In that Chriſt makes the tender of himſelf, and by that ordinarily faith is wrought in the heart to embrace that tender, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 17. <hi>Zacheus</hi> obtained Chriſt by being in the way of Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 4. the Ordinances are the <hi>Sycamore-tree.</hi> C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Thus did <hi>Zacheus,</hi> Luke 19. 5, 6. <hi>Zacheus, Come down, &amp;c.

When you finde your ſtomack crave meat and drink; think, O what ſhall I do for ſpiritual meat and drink?</p>
               <p n="2">II. To ſuch as have an intereſt in Chriſt, who is meat and drink, let me commend a few things to you.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Feed on him.</hi> Eat and drink of this fleſh and blood every day. Chriſtians grow weak, becauſe they let their meat and drink ſtand by them. 'Tis not the fleſh in the pot, but the fleſh in the ſtomack that gives nouriſhment. 'Tis not the drink in the veſſel, but the drink taken down that revives. Stir up ſpiritual hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and that will make you feed heartily on Chriſt. Eat and drink Chriſt by <hi>Meditation,</hi> eat
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:38484:40"/>
and drink him by <hi>Application.</hi> Let your faith draw in Chriſt in every Ordinance. Keep your Spiritual meals as conſtantly as you do your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meales. Your eating will help you to a ſtomack. Satisfaction and hunger are mutual helps one to another. Eating and drinking o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meat takes away the appetite, but it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth the ſpiritual appetite. Fixed times of ſpiritual feeding every day, are marvellous profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. When you have prayed, call your heart to account what it hath taken in of Chriſt. When you have been reading, ask it what nouriſhment it hath received from the Word. When the Lords Supper is over, enquire what refreſhment is received. Put your ſelves for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to frequent, conſtant, actual feeding. It's pitty ſuch precious meat and drink ſhould ſtand in corners, when the ſoule hath ſo much need of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Be thankful for this meat and drink.</hi> That it is provided for any; that it is actually dealt out to you; That you have that meat and drink which others want. There are many that have no other meat but ſinne. They drink iniquity like water, <hi>Job</hi> 15. 16. Some eat the bread of violence, and drink the wine of deceit. Some there are that drink the wine of the condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the houſe of their God, <hi>Amos</hi> 2. 8. They eat the fleſh of men, and drink their blood like new wine, <hi>Micah</hi> 3. 3. The greateſt part of men have no other meat then the pulſe of worldly comforts; no other drink then the puddle wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of created things; and thou haſt the fleſh and blood of Jeſus Chriſt to eat and drink: prize and value at an high rate the exceeding riches of this grace. We are to bleſſe God for
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:38484:40"/>
our corporal meat and drink. Jeſus Chriſt gave thanks when he ate and drank, <hi>John</hi> 6. 11: And ſo did the Apoſtles, <hi>Acts</hi> 27. 35. and ſo ſhould all men do. It is bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh to eat and drink without Thankſgiving. How much more cauſe have we to bleſſe God for our ſpiritual meat and drink! The corporall is common to us with others; This is peculiar onely to the Elect; no other ſhall taſte of this proviſion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Let your growth be anſwerable to ſuch excellent feeding.</hi> God expects that our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall growth ſhould be proportionable to our ſpiritual feeding.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bos Macer pingui in arvo,</hi> is prodigious. Husbandmen expect that when they put their cattel into paſtures that are rich, where there is plenty of graſſe, and abundance of water, they expect that their growth ſhould be anſwerable. The Saints of God are highly fed. They have Angels meat, ſhould they not then do Angels work? If you do not grow very faſt, you will bring up an evil report of Chriſt; as if his fleſh were not nouriſhing meat, as if his blood were not nouriſhing drink, as if it were meat in ſhew, and not meat <hi>indeed;</hi> as if it were drink in ſhew, not drink <hi>indeed.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt may repent that his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was broken, his blood poured out to be meat and drink for you that are ſtill leane and ill-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, even dwarfs in grace. It's the Saints pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge that they ſhall grow, becauſe Chriſt is their feeder; and it is their duty, becauſe they have ſuch food, to be carefully mindful of grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Every limb of the new man ſhould thrive. We ſhould grow lower in humility, higher in heavenly-mindedneſſe; broader and thicker
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:38484:41"/>
in ſpiritual affections, &amp;c. you cannot expreſſe your thankfulneſſe for this royal meat and drink, any other way ſo much to the contentment of Chriſt, as by growing abundantly. It is that which our Saviour requires as a teſtimony of our union with him, and of thankfulneſſe for that feeding vertue we receive from him, <hi>John</hi> 15. 5, 8. As he is unworthy of meat that doth not labour, ſo is he more unworthy that doth not grow.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Shew pitty to others that feed on other meat and drink.</hi> Endeavour to communicate Chriſt to thoſe that want him. We naturally pity famiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men; lean cheeks, and pale faces work ſome bowels in a miſer, in an enemy. Commend Chriſt to others, perſwade them to embrace him. You ſhall feel no want of meat and drink for your ſelves, by communicating Chriſt to others. Though a thouſand eat and drink of him, no one ſhall have the leſſe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Do not deſpair of ſpiritual growth and strength.</hi> 'Tis a diſhonour to Chriſt to think that he ſhould ſtarve you. His fleſh is ſtrengthning fleſh, his blood is ſtrengthening blood, quickening blood. 'Tis full of ſpirits, 'tis full of life. Though thy graces be weak, thy ſpiritual diſeaſes violent, yet deſpair not. Thou receiveſt more from Chriſt, then thou canſt loſe or ſpend.</p>

            </list>
            <p n="1">1. That Chriſt is a garment. This will appear two wayes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>From expreſſe Scriptures.</hi> All thoſe texts where mention is made of the putting on of Chriſt, are teſtimonies of this truth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 17. As many as are baptized into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt. That in <hi>Eſay</hi> 61. 10. <hi>I will rejoyce in the Lord, for he hath cloathed me with the robes of righteouſneſſe; he hath put upon me the garments of ſalvation. Jerom</hi> expounds it of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>ſalvatorem &amp; juſtificatorem noſtrum;</hi> who co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers us with his own righteouſneſſe as with a precious robe of ſalvation. This is taught by our Saviour in that counſel which he gives to the naked Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> Rev. 3. 18. <hi>I counſel thee to buy of me gold, &amp;c. and white rayment that thou mayſt be cloathed.</hi> What are thoſe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> but Jeſus Chriſt himſelf imputed and applied to the ſoule, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52. 2? its ſpoken of deliverance from <hi>Babylon,</hi> and more fully of redemption by Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>From typical or more myſterious Scriptures.</hi> There are many of this kinde.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) <hi>Thoſe garments of skins wherewith God cloathed our firſt parents after the fall.</hi> You read
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:38484:43"/>
of them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 21. This was not without a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery. <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> hath this note upon that place, that by theſe garments was ſhadowed out the promiſed Meſſiah, that bleſſed ſeed of the woman, who ſhould be ſacrificed upon the croſſe, and cut out (as it were) into garments for the cloathing of Gods Elect. The like is obſerved by Interpreters from thoſe kid-skins which <hi>Rebeccah</hi> put upon the hands of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and upon the ſmooth of his neck, when ſhe ſent him to his Father for the bleſſing, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. 16. They did decipher Chriſt, with whom the ſoul being cloathed obtaines a bleſſing from the hands of God.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) <hi>Thoſe garments of the High Priests.</hi> God appointed in the Law that glorious garments ſhould be made for <hi>Aaron.</hi> You read of them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. 2. What was typified by thoſe gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? They related to Chriſt. As the High Prieſt did typifie Chriſt; ſo the garments did ſet out the pure adminiſtration of Chriſt, who offered up himſelf without ſpot, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. and they did alſo teach the people of God, that it is Jeſus Chriſt that cloathes their ſoules with choice raiment, that fine linnen which is the righteouſneſſe of Saints, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 18. This type is more fully expounded in <hi>Zech.</hi> 3. 3, 4. Thoſe filthy garments noted <hi>Joſhuab</hi>'s ſinnes, and the ſinnes of the people. That rayment which was afterward put upon him, did ſignifie Chriſt and his righteouſneſſe, wherewith all ſpiritual Prieſts are gloriouſly decked and cloathed.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) <hi>The wedding-garment in the Goſpel.</hi> You read of it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 11, 12. What is meant by this wedding garment, but Jeſus Chriſt, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apprehended, and put on by faith, works and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:38484:43"/>
creates the ſaving fruits of grace in the heart, and in the life?</p>
            <p n="2">II. Wherein ſtands the Analogy? There are ſeveral uſes of garments, in all which reſpects Chriſt is a garment to the ſoul.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Garments are for the covering of the body.</hi> Men uſe garments, that the nakedneſſe of their bodies may not appeare to the eyes of others; for this reaſon did our firſt parents few fig-leaves together to hide their nakedneſſe. In the ſtate of innocency, when the body was without guilt, nakedneſſe was the greateſt Ornament; when ſinne had polluted the body, then was nakedneſs deformity; therefore man ſought the beſt gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he could to cover that nakedneſſe. For the ſame reaſon did God afterwards make man garments of skins to cloath him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 17. Jeſus Chriſt is a covering to the ſoul. He is the Lamb of God that did not onely redeeme us by his blood, <hi>ſed etiam lanis operuit,</hi> ſaith <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1.) He covers the deformity of our natural filthineſſe.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) He covers the uglineſſe of our actual ſins, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. 2.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) He covers all the ſpots of our holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. The mercy-ſeat under the Law, covered the two Tables of the Decalogue, <hi>vid. Exod.</hi> 25, 17, 18, 21. This mercy-ſeat did typifie Chriſt, who is called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. as the mercy-ſeat is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 5. the <hi>Cherubims</hi> covered the mercy-ſeat, and the mercy-ſeat covered the Ark in which were the two Tables of the Law. Jeſus Chriſt is that covering mercy-ſeat, that covers or plaiſters over all the ſinnes which beleevers commit againſt the Law of God. Hence it is
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:38484:44"/>
that God is ſaid not to behold iniquity in <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> Numb. 23. 31. He doth not ſee it to impute it, becauſe it is hidden under the covering mercy-ſeat, Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Garments are for Ornament.</hi> They do ſet out the body<hi>—Viro veſtis magnum decus addit honeſta.</hi> Garments to the body are as rich hangings or coſtly varniſh over a wall of clay, they make it look better then it would do. Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments do mend the crookedneſſe of bodies that are bowed, and they do ſet out the perfections of beautiful bodies. Jeſus Chriſt may well be compared to a garment in this reſpect he puts a beauty upon the ſoule, a rich, laſting, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect beauty. Therefore it is that he is compared to the wedding-garment, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 12. and to the High Prieſts garments, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. 2. which were made for beauty and glory. Hence it is that beleevers that are loathſom and crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in themſelves, are made ſo excellently beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful in Chriſt. You read much in <hi>Solomons</hi> ſong of a beleevers comelineſſe, <hi>Vid. Chap.</hi> 4. 1 2, 3, &amp;c. and againe, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. 1, 2, 3. 4. &amp;c. 'Tis becauſe of the beautiful dreſſe in which he is attired. The comely garment puts comelineſſe on him that weares it. You read of the orient beauty and rich attire of the Kings daughter, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45 13, 14. The Kings daughter is the real Saint, the cloathing of wrought gold, and the rayment of needle-work, is nothing but Chriſt, and the graces he brings with him in which the ſoule is inveſted. Chriſt is the onely Ornament indeed. He is a crown and diadem upon the head, he is a jewel in the boſome, he is a ring upon the finger. No ſoul hath any true beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (though outwardly cloathed in ſcarlet) that
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:38484:44"/>
hath not on it this garment. Chriſt is the ſoules Ornament, as he is a juſtifier, and as he is a ſanctifier, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. He adorns us as he is our juſtification, putting us into a ſtate of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe. And he adornes us as he is our Sanctification, by communicating unto us his own comelineſſe in the ſeeds of holineſſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Garments are for the defending of the body.</hi> They are <hi>munimenta corporis.</hi> They are as light armour upon the body. In the Winter they guard the body againſt the nipping cold; in the Summer they preſerve, and defend it from the parching heat. Every blaſt would pinch the body, were it not for our garments, every thorn would prick, every ſtone would bruiſe the foot if it were not fenced by that rayment which is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. The garments are a little movable Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon in which the body marches through many inconveniences which otherwiſe it could not do. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt is the defence of the ſoul; he ſaves it from many a knock which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe it would get.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>He defends the ſoul from ſinne.</hi> Sinne hath not that power and dominion over a beleever that is cloathed with Chriſt, as it hath over the ſoule that is uncloathed. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 14. <hi>Sinne ſhall not have dominion over you.</hi> Chriſt keeps ſinne from bearing that ſway in a Saint which it doth in other men. It is a vanquiſhed, wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, crucified enemy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>He defends them from the rage and fury of men.</hi> Man would teare them to pieces, if this garment did not interpoſe between their rage and the ſoule. Of this our Saviour ſpeaks, <hi>John</hi> 16. 33. the ſting cannot touch the skin till it pierce thorough the rayment. The arrow
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:38484:45"/>
cannot wound the body till it pierce through the garment. Jeſus Chriſt preſerves his people from the devouring teeth of ungodly enraged men.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>He defends them from the fiery aſſaults and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets of the devil.</hi> Simon, Simon, <hi>Satan hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to ſift thee as wheat is ſifted: but I have pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for thee that thy faith may not faile,</hi> Luk. 22. 32. This roaring Lion would tear them into pieces, if this impenetrable garment were not betwixt his teeth and their ſoules. Theſe fiery darts would ſtrike to their very hearts, did not this garment dead them and beat them back againe. That the devil by his malice and power doth not deſtroy you, it is becauſe you are cloathed with this garment. Could Satan either break tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, or pluck off this garment, he would as ſoon prevaile over you, as he doth over o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>He defends them from eternal wrath.</hi> God is in himſelf to ſinful men a conſuming fire, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 29. This fire doth not burne, nay it doth not ſinge the beleever, becauſe he hath this garment upon him, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 10. 'Tis a beleevers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that the wrath of God muſt burne Jeſus Chriſt, before it can burne him. The hotteſt flames cannot ſo much as touch the body till they have burnt thorough the garments. The wrath of God cannot ſeize any more on Chriſt, he hath laine under it once for ever, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſhall never ſeize upon the beleever that is incircled about with Chriſt, as the body is with the garment. The fire cannot devoure the man while the ſcreen ſtands between him and the flame; Jeſus Chriſt is a beleevers ſcreen, which ſtands continually between him and the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:38484:45"/>
devouring flame of Gods anger.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Garments are for the warmth of the body.</hi> 'Tis a great piece of the providencial care of God, that garments that have no heat in them, ſhould give warmth to the body, <hi>Job</hi> 37. 17. The garments receive heat from the body, and then they keep the body warm, <hi>Job</hi> 31. 20. if he were not warmed with the fleece of my ſheep. Jeſus Chriſt is in this reſpect truly a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the ſoul; he keeps the ſoule in a good warmth. There is indeed no ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al warmth till Chriſt have wrought it, and when it is wrought, 'tis preſerved by vertue of this garment. The two Diſciples were very chill, as cold as yee till Chriſt wrought a holy heat in them; then they began to glow, yea, to burne; <hi>Did not our hearts burne within u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, &amp;c. Luke</hi> 24. 32? if you finde any holy heat with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you, you are to attribute it to this heart-warming garment, as to the onely cauſe of it. The Ordinances would never heat you, if Chriſt did not firſt heat them. We are by nature as cold as that childe was, when his ſpirit was departed, 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 4. 34. And yet Jeſus Chriſt by laying himſelf upon us, chafes us into a lively warmth.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Garments are uſed for distinction.</hi> They dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference one ſex from another. God would have the ſexes diſtinguiſhed viſibly by their apparel, <hi>Deut.</hi> 22. 5. <hi>The man ſhall not put on that which appertaineth to the woman, &amp;c.</hi> And as they diſtinguiſh ſexes, ſo they ſhould diſtinguiſh the conditions of men: they that weare ſoft ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are in Kings Courts, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 8. The ſervant and Maſter now cannot be diſtinguiſhed by their apparel unleſſe it be thus, that the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant

excels, the Merchant and Mechanick, the Prince and Peſant ſcarce diſtinguiſhed. God would have it otherwiſe, rayment ſhould di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh conditions as well as ſexes. Chriſt in this regard is fitly compared to a garment. He diſtinguiſhes between the beleever and the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever, between the regenerate and the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17. <hi>If any man be in Chriſt, he is a new creature, and</hi> 2 Cor. 13. 5. <hi>know you not that Ieſus Chriſt is in you except you be reprobates.</hi> God hath made Jeſus Chriſt to be the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing character between him that ſhall be ſaved, and him that ſhall periſh.</p>

He is as needful for the ſoul, yea, more needful then garments are for the body.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Ieſus Chriſt is a large garment.</hi> Other garments can cover but one at once. One gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cannot cloath ſeveral perſons, no more then one morſel can feed ſeveral men. But Jeſus
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:38484:46"/>
Chriſt is a garment of ſuch extent and dimenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he can cover many, though they be at never ſo great a diſtance. Should I feare ſaith <hi>Bernard,</hi> that Chriſts righteouſneſſe will not ſerve for him and me? No, <hi>Non eſt pallium breve, quod duos operire non poteſt.</hi> All the Elect of God, though they live in ſeveral Nations, though they be a multitude which no man can number, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 9. yet they are all cloathed, and all ſufficiently cloathed with this one garment. I ſaw ſaith the Evangeliſt, a wonder in heaven, a woman cloathed with the Sun, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 1. This woman is the whole Church of God. This Sunne that covers the woman, is Chriſt the Sunne of righteouſneſſe, as he is called, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4. 1. His skirt is large enough to cover his whole Church, and yet never a member can complain of want.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Ieſus Chriſt is a garment for every part.</hi> Your material garments will not ſerve every part. That which is proper for the head will not cover the loynes; that which fits the body will not fit the feet. Every part of the body hath a diſtinct cloathing which is onely proper for it ſelf. But now Chriſt is a garment that fits every part. He is the Diadem or Crown upon the head, he is the robe upon the body, he is the ſhooes upon the feet, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 22. Chriſt is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat ſuit of apparel, from head to foot the ſoul is perfectly cloathed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Ieſus Chriſt hath the uſes of all garments.</hi> There is no one garment that ſerves for all uſes to the body. Some Garments are good for covering, but they are not for beauty. Others ſerve for ornament and beauty, but they do not ſerve for defence. Some garments are good in
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:38484:47"/>
the cold, but they are not ſo uſeful and fit in a time of heat. Perſons that are of ability have ſeveral garments for ſeveral uſes, becauſe no one garment is fit for all. But Jeſus Chriſt is a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for all uſes to the ſoule. He is for co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, and for ornament, and for defence; as good for all uſes as for any uſe. He is a Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-garment, and he is a Summer-garment; he is as good for cooling as for heating. He is the travellors, and he is the labourers garment, and he is the ſouldiers garment. He is light for walking, thick for ſtormy weather; He is ſtrong for fighting, and ſpiritual warring againſt Satan and his temptations. Chriſt ſuits all the occaſions of the ſoule. <hi>He is wiſdome, righteouſneſſe, ſanctification and redemption,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 30.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is a garment fit for all ſexes, for all ſizes, for all conditions.</hi> No one garment will fit all bodies. That which is decency in one ſex would be monſtrouſneſſe on the other. That garment which fits a childe, would be unuſeful to a grown man. That which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the Subject, would be unſutable for the Princes weare. But now Chriſt is as proper for one as for another. He is as fit for the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, as for the man; for the childe, as for the father; for the King, as for the Subject. As the Apoſtle ſaith in another caſe, we may ſay in this. <hi>There is neither Barbarian, Scythian, Jew nor Gentile, male nor female, bond nor free, but ye are all one in Chriſt,</hi> Col. 3. 11. God hath made Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt a fit garment for the ſoules of all ſorts of men. There is no ſoul too big, none too little, none too ſmall, none too great for Jeſus Chriſt to array and cover.</p>

                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:38484:47"/>
5. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is a durable garment.</hi> All other garments are of a moldring nature. The moth corrupts them; old age takes away the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of them; the ſtrongeſt and fineſt garments turne to rags by daily uſe. But Jeſus Chriſt is a laſting garment; the moth cannot fret it, old age cannot weare it thin. Chriſt is now as freſh as when he was firſt put upon <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe. When our bodily garments ſhall be pluckt off, yea, when the very garments of our bodies like the mantle of <hi>Elijah,</hi> ſhall fall into duſt, then will this garment abide upon the ſoul as beautiful as now it is. The Lord did miraculouſly preſerve the garments of the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites from waxing old, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 4. Though they were worne fourty yeares in the wilderneſſe, yet they were not threed-bare. Their bodies waſted, but their garments did not waſte. They were as freſh when they came to <hi>Canaan</hi> as they were when they came out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, though he be worne every day, yet he doth not wax old. He is as freſh upon the ſoul on its dying day, as upon the firſt moment of its regeneration.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Jeſus Christ is a free garment.</hi> All that is required on mens part is to put him on. He is provided without our coſt, without our care. Though he be the moſt coſtly garment in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, yet he is the moſt cheap garment in the world. Other garments cannot be had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out money, Chriſt is obtained without money, without price. The Scripture ſpeaks of buying him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 18. this buying is free receiving. The Prophets expound the phraſe, <hi>Eſay</hi> 55. 1. <hi>Buy milk and wine without money, without price.</hi> Indeed this garment is ſo invaluably rich, that
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:38484:48"/>
all the treaſure in the world cannot purchaſe one inch of it. He that dreames of buying Chriſt, ſhall die without Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>Behold the ſufficiency of Chriſt for ſpiritual life.</hi> Two things are neceſſary for the bodily life, food and rayment, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 8. Jeſus Chriſt is both food and rayment. He is ſet out as rayment in Baptiſme. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 27. and he is held out as food in the Sacrament of the Supper. He is every way ſufficient for all the concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the ſoule; he feeds it, he cloaths it, and that with the beſt food, and the beſt ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with himſelf. His fleſh is meat, his blood is drink, his righteouſneſſe is cloathing, ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial durable cloathing.</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>The miſery of thoſe that are without Chriſt.</hi> All men are by nature ſtrangers to Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 12. He that is without Chriſt, is without ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual rayment, he is a naked man. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture calls the ſtate of nature a ſtate of naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 4, 8. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 18. A naked conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is a miſerable condition. Nakedneſſe is a very comprehenſive word. A naked man is expoſed to the ſcorn of every eye, its a ſhameful object, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 18. A naked man is expoſed to every ſtorm; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhower wets him, every wind pierces him. A na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man is unfit for employment; he is neither fit to fight, nor to labour. Such as are without Chriſt are unſpeakably miſerable. Their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is full of ſhame, their condition is full of danger; they have nothing to cover them from Gods wrath, from the devils rage. They have nothing to warme their hearts when they are cold with feares, terrors, deſpaires, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual anguiſh. A naked body amongſt dar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:38484:48"/>
as a naked ſoule expoſed to the arrows of Gods wrath. They are as unfit for any work, as the naked man is for labour and travel, <hi>Vid. Eſay</hi> 3. 6. he that is without Chriſt, hath neither bread nor rayment.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. <hi>The miſery of thoſe that reject Chriſt.</hi> None but mad men and barbarous men reject cloathing. 'Tis the character of a diſtracted mad-man to refuſe raiment. <hi>Vid. Luke</hi> 8. 27. You read a ſad ſtory of a man poſſeſſed with a Legion of devils, and the text ſaith, he wore no cloathes; his madneſſe is evidenced by that that he would ſuffer no cloathes to be put upon him; for <hi>v.</hi> 35. When Chriſt had cured him, the text ſaith, he ſate at the feet of Jeſus cloathed, and in his right minde. 'Tis a ſigne that that man is ſpiritually poſſeſſed with a Legion of devils, that will not be cloathed with this ſpiritual garment. And yet the world is full of theſe ſpiritual Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lams. They will go naked. Let Miniſters ſay what they will, let the ſpirit of God uſe never ſo much importunity, they will not be cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. They will have none of Chriſt. Theſe garments are hanged out every day in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick market, yea, men are intreated to take them even without money, and yet they will not. Is it not juſt that ſuch men ſhould be buried in hell in their own rags, that will not embrace Chriſt that they may be cloathed with eternal ſalvation.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. <hi>'Its the duty of men to put on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This is often recommended to us in Scripture. Two things I ſhall briefly open.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What it is to put on Chriſt, How we muſt put him on. 2. Why we muſt put him on.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Chriſt is put on two wayes. There is a double putting on of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>A putting on of Chriſt for juſtification.</hi> When by faith we apply him unto our ſelves, by faith for righteouſneſſe. The Apoſtle tells us that Chriſt is made unto us of God <hi>juſtification,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 30. He is called <hi>Jehovah, our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,</hi> Jer. 23 6. 'Tis by his righteouſneſſe that the beleever is conſtituted righteous in <hi>foro Dei;</hi> which is by an act of grace of God imputing and reckoning this perfect righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt unto him, as his own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Now then doth a perſon put on Chriſt, when by an act of faith, he doth apply Chriſt and his righteouſneſſe unto himſelf for juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This was that which the Apoſtle deſired, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 9 <hi>That he might be found in Chriſt, not having his own righteouſneſſe which is by the Law, but that which is by the faith of Ieſus Christ, the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of God by faith.</hi> When this righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe is actually applied, received, relied up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then is Chriſt put on: This is one piece.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>A putting on of Chriſt by imitation.</hi> When we imitate the gracious life of Chriſt. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to Sanctification, and new obedience. To put on Chriſt, is <hi>virtute Spiritus Chriſti undique nos munire, quâ idonei ad omnes partes ſanctitatis</hi>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:38484:49"/>
                  <hi>reddamur,</hi> Calvin. And ſo <hi>Eraſmus.</hi> In as much as ye are ſpiritually ingraffed into Chriſt, <hi>hunc ipſum induite, eluceat in omni vitâ quem ſitis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſi, exprimite quem imbibiſtis, &amp;c.</hi> Zuinglius. When we apply his righteouſneſſe for our juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, when we put on his example, and expreſſe his vertues in a courſe of ſanctification, then, and not till then do we put on Chriſt as the Scripture requires.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Why we muſt put him on. There is good reaſon. I might be large in each, but I ſhall onely give general Reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Christ is of no effect to us if we do not put him on.</hi> Garments neither warm, nor cover, nor defend, nor adorne the body if they be not put on. Chriſt is rendred invalid to ſuch as do not apply him. His righteouſneſſe will not juſtifie you, if you do not by faith put it on as a garment. His holy life will do you no good if you do not imitate it. His righteouſneſſe will periſh as to you; his vertues will be loſt as to you, if you do not actually put on both. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of making Chriſt of no effect, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 4.</p>

            <p n="1">1. The conſtitution of this Kingdome, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. to 9.</p>
            <p n="2">2. An exhortation given unto the people, by repentance to prevent the miſeries which ſhould happen before the conſtitution of this Kingdom, <hi>v.</hi> 9. to 15.</p>

            <p n="4">4. The concluſion of all in that <hi>Epiphonema,</hi> v. 20. wherin the Prophet compares the people of God to thoſe happy husbandmen, who are in expectation of a plentiful harveſt, after their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and coſt in tilling and ſowing.

            <p n="1">(1.) <hi>The ſafe adminiſtration of it.</hi> This is in the two former verſes. <hi>Behold a King, &amp;c.</hi> By <hi>King,</hi> we are to underſtand <hi>Chriſt</hi> the King of his Church; by <hi>Princes</hi> we are to underſtand thoſe that do under Chriſt adminiſter this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. 'Tis an allegory taken from humane Kingdomes, in which the King himſelfe, and all his officers do adminiſter in righteouſneſſe.

The Text falls under the firſt of theſe; <hi>viz.</hi> the ſafe adminiſtration of this Kingdome. <hi>And a man, &amp;c.</hi> we may divide it into two parts. 1. A danger hinted, <hi>Winde.</hi> 2. A remedy diſcovered, in which are,</p>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Protection.</hi> This is ſet down by way of compariſon. Here are foure reſemblances. 1. As a hiding place from the winde. 2. As a covert from the tempeſt. 3. As rivers of water in a drie place. 4. As the ſhadow of a great rock in a weary land. I am now to ſpeak of the firſt, namely, <hi>a hiding place from the winde.</hi> By <hi>winde</hi> we are to underſtand, troubles, afflictions, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous ſtormes, whether they be outward or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Here are four words which all ſignifie one and the ſame thing; onely they are varyed a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, that they may be fitted to the ſeveral meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors: winde, tempeſt, a dry place, a weary land, Trials, tribulations, temptations are uſually called winde in Scripture, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 27. <hi>The raine deſcended, and the windes blew, and the floods came, &amp;c.</hi> Two Obſervations lie cleere in the Text.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That godly men muſt expect windy days e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the times of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That Jeſus Chriſt is a hiding place to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers in all the windy dayes which they meet with in this life.</p>
            <p>I ſhall begin with the firſt, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>Doct. 1. <hi>That godly men muſt expect to meet</hi>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:38484:53"/>
               <hi>with windy dayes even under the Kingdome of Chriſt:</hi> Chriſts Kingdom, though it be a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Kingdome, yet it is not without ſtormy windes and tempeſts. There is under the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt a great deal of inward peace, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renity and calmneſſe under the Kingdome of Chriſt. The Scripture foretels this, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72. 7. <hi>In his dayes ſhall the righteous flouriſh, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of peace, ſo long as the moone endureth,</hi> Eſay 32. 17, 18. <hi>The work of righteouſneſſe ſhall be peace, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>my people ſhall dwell in a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able habitation, and in ſure dwellings, and in qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et reſting places.</hi> And the Scripture makes mention of external peace and quietneſſe which ſhall be under the Kingdome of Chriſt, <hi>Eſay</hi> 11. 6, 7, 8. <hi>The wolf alſo ſhall dwell with the lamb, &amp;c.</hi> And, <hi>Mic.</hi> 4. 3, 4 <hi>He ſhall judge among many people, and rebuke ſtrong Nations afar off;</hi> and <hi>they ſhall break their ſwords into plow-ſhares, and their ſpears into pruning books, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe and many prophecies of this nature are yet, I ſuppoſe, to be fulfilled, and they ſhall have their accompliſhment before the end of this life. But yet beleevers are to meet with windy dayes even in Goſpel times.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Windy dayes of outward troubles.</hi> Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward afflictions of all ſorts are to be expected, ſickneſſe, weakneſſe, poverty, reproach, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution and all other evils. Theſe windes have blown very ſharp upon the Apoſtles, Diſciples, Martyrs, and other ſervants of God in their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations; yea, upon whole Churches, the ſeven Churches are overturned by them. And they do ſo continue to this very day. <hi>Through many tribulations we muſt enter into the Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> This was <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrine, <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 22. <hi>Ye</hi>

And our Saviour himſelf foretold the Church before his departure, that theſe winds would ariſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 33. <hi>In the world ye ſhall have tribulation.</hi> And <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 22. <hi>the holy City is given unto the Gentiles to be trod under foot fourty two moneths,</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 3. of that Chapter, the witneſſes ſhall for the ſpace of one thouſand two hundred ſixty dayes (which is the whole time of Antichriſts reigne) <hi>prophecy in ſackcloth;</hi> and to this very day we ſee they have their ſackcloth upon their loynes.

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Windy dayes of inward troubles;</hi> Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, deſertions, inward fears and ſhakings in the ſoul. There will be theſe ſpiritual earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes and agonies in the ſoules of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple even in Goſpel-times. This winde did beat violently upon the Apoſtles; <hi>without were ſight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, within were feares,</hi> 2 Cor. 7. 5. <hi>Paul</hi> felt theſe windes make a horrible noiſe in his bowels, in thoſe fierce buffettings of Satan which he ſpeaks of, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. yea, theſe windes blew fiercely upon Chriſt himſelf, when he uttered thoſe doleful words; <hi>Eli, Eli, Lamaſab achthani, My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Mat. 27. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="1">1. There is a devil, an Antichriſt, wicked men even under Chriſts Kingdom.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>There is ſinne under the Goſpel.</hi> And where
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:38484:54"/>
there is ſinne, there cannot but be windes. The winde is (as the Philoſopher teacheth us) an exhalation ariſing from the earth, drawn up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by the power of the Sunne, which meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the cold of the middle region of the aire, is beaten back againe; it is ſo light that it cannot deſcend, and ſo violently reſiſted that it cannot aſcend, therefore it is carried aſlaunt with a mighty violence through the aire. The matter of windes is an exhalation mixed for the <note place="margin">Magir. Phyſ.</note> moſt part with vapours, from whence it is that the winde is ſometimes moiſt. The ſame exhalations or vapours incloſed in the bowels of the earth, and not finding an open paſſage cauſe an earthquake. Sinne is the matter of ſpiritual windes without, and ſpiritual earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes within. Now as there will be windes and earthquakes where there is the matter of them; ſo there cannot but be the windes of outward troubles, and the earthquakes of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual troubles where ſinne is, which doth ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and breed both theſe. Now the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God ſinne under the Goſpel, and from their ſinnes do theſe windes and earthquakes proceed. Sinne creates ſtormes in Goſpel-dayes.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Theſe windes are for the advantage of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers even under the Goſpel; ye are in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on if need be, through manifold temptations,</hi> 1 Pet 16. The windes are not more neceſſary for the world, then theſe windes are for the ſoules of Gods people even in Goſpel times; I ſhall ſhew you the uſefulneſſe of the windes of heaven for the earth, and ſhew you the uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of theſe ſpiritual windes in the ſame reſpects to the ſoul.

               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:38484:54"/>
1. <hi>The winde is uſeful for purification.</hi> The winde cleanſeth and ſweetens the aire, carries away &amp; diſperſes noyſom and infectious vapours that are hurtful to the bodies of men and other creatures; the winde is <hi>ventilabrum naturae,</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures fan by which all putrefying vapours are driven away, <hi>Vid.</hi> Job 37. 21. <hi>Men ſee not the bright light which is in the clouds: but the winde paſſeth and cleanſeth them.</hi> Theſe ſpiritual winds, both inward and outward have, when ſanctified by God, a purifying vertue. Thoſe corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infectious miſts and vapours of ſinne which pollute the ſoule, are purged and driven away by the blaſts of theſe windes. <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. 35. <hi>Many ſhall fall, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o try them, and to purge them, and to make them white.</hi> No ſoule is ordinarily ſo full of infectious ſavour as thoſe that want theſe windes. <hi>Moab hath been at eaſe from his youth, &amp;c,</hi> Eſay 48. 11. And no Chriſtians have ſuch ſweet ſoules as thoſe that are frequently viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with theſe windes of trouble. Corruption will hardly faſten where theſe windes do or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily blow. Saints have foggy ſouls in Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The winde hath a ſearching vertue.</hi> It's a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating creature; If there be the leaſt chink or cranie, the winde will finde it out. As the light findes out the leaſt hole, ſo doth the winde. Theſe ſpiritual windes are of a ſearching and diſcovering nature. Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, deſertions, outward troubles, will ſearch the very inward parts of the ſoul. Chriſtians have found out thoſe defects in themſelves, which they could never eſpy till God ſent theſe windes to blow upon them. Many holes and cranies they have ſeen in their own ſpirits; which
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:38484:55"/>
they could never diſcerne till theſe windy days aroſe upon them. <hi>He openeth their years to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,</hi> and <hi>ſhews them wherein they have exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> Job 36. 9. Tranſgreſſions, exceſſes, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual defects too are found out by theſe winds and tempeſts. Our Saviour layes down this uſeful effect of theſe tempeſtuous dayes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 25, 27. the <hi>winds blew, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>it fell not, &amp;c.</hi> Great windes do diſcover whether your houſes be made of firme timber, or of ſhaking rotten wood. Theſe ſpiritual windes are great diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verers, eſpecially if they be in extremity. <hi>A ſword ſhall pierce through thine own ſoul alſo, that the thoughts of many hearts may be diſcovered.</hi> The words of <hi>Simeon</hi> to the <hi>Virgin-Mary,</hi> Luke 2. 35. the ſtony ground is not diſcovered till theſe windes ariſe, but then 'tis fully diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 20, 21. No Chriſtian knows him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſo thoroughly as he that hath travelled thorough theſe guſts of trouble. <hi>Peter</hi> did not know his own weakneſſe till theſe high windes had ſearched him; then he ſaw the unworthy fear and Apoſtaſie of his own heart, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 70, 72, 74. <hi>Peter</hi> did not know his own di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſtfulneſſe till the winde began to be boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous, then he ſaw he could ſink as well as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man, <hi>Mat.</hi> 14. 30. Saints need ſelf-diſcovery under Chriſts Kingdome.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The winde hath a cooling vertue.</hi> When the aire is heated by the ſcortching beames of the Sunne, the winde paſſeth thorough it, and brings it into a coole temper againe. Theſe ſpiritual windes coole the ſoul. Chriſtians are ſometimes ſcalding-hot in the purſuit of the world, or perhaps of ſome ſinne. God ſtirs up theſe windes and cooles that heat. Some
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:38484:55"/>
ſharp winde of diſtreſſe of conſcience, ſome guſt of temptation, ſome piercing blaſt of trouble abares thoſe feveriſh heats, removes that eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which was before in the ſoul after things that cannot profit. That winde of God that blew in <hi>Pauls</hi> face, coold that zeal for perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution which was in his heart, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 1, 3, 4.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The wind makes men keep their garments cloſer about them.</hi> You have heard of the fable of the Sunne and the Winde ſtriving for the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers cloak; the iſſue was, the Sunne got it; the more violently the Winde blew, the faſter he held it. Theſe ſpiritual Windes make the ſoul look better to his ſpiritual garments; he holds all his graces faſter then, then at another time. He keeps his faith, his hope, his patience, his integrity tackt cloſe about him. <hi>Job</hi> never was ſo careful of keeping his garments, as when he met with theſe windes. <hi>Vid.</hi> Chap. 27. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>As God liveth ſaith he, who hath taken away my judgement, &amp;c. All that while my breath is in me, &amp;c. my righteouſneſſe I hold faſt and will not let it go, till I die I will not remove my integrity from me.</hi> Souldiers never keep their armour ſo carefully as when they come to an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter. Chriſtians are never ſo careful of their ſpiritual harneſſe as when the windes of tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and temptation beat upon them; And we have need to keep our garments even under the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>The winde hath an awakening power.</hi> When it lifts up its voice with violence, the noiſe is ſo dreadful, that ſleep is taken away from thoſe that heare it. The Mariner cannot ſleep when the windes are up. The Ship-maſter wondred
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:38484:56"/>
that <hi>Jonah</hi> could ſleep when the Windes were ſo high, and the Sea ſo raging, <hi>Jonah</hi> 1. 6. Theſe ſpiritual Windes awaken the ſoule out of ſloath and carnal ſecurity. When there is an earthquake of inward trouble in the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; when there is a tempeſt of outward trouble upon the body, the ſoul is made more watchful then ever it was; if theſe ſtormes be ſanctified it will be ſo. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 4. <hi>Thou holdeſt mine eyes waking,</hi> ſaith <hi>Aſaph.</hi> That ſtorme of temptation which then lay upon him, kept the eyes of his ſoul waking, as well as the eyes of his body. That earthquake which was at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, when <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> ſang praiſes to God, awakened the ſleepy Jaylor, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 26, 27. the natural conſcience is ſtartled by ſuch providences, much more is the regenerate conſcience. Theſe Windes are Gods Phyſick which he uſeth to remove ſpiritual ſecurity; and God will make it effectual to accompliſh his end. <hi>Jonah</hi> ſlept a while, but God did awake him both in his ſleepy body, and more ſleepy ſoule, before theſe windes ceaſed blowing, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26, 40, 41, 43. Saints under the Goſpel have need of awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

               <p>Uſe 1. <hi>Expect theſe windy dayes.</hi> Do not think that now the Goſpel is come, now Chriſts Kingdome is ſet up, ſtormes are at an end. God doth every day confute this folly. The end of one tempeſt hath been the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of another. Hitherto it hath been ſo, and we can ſee nothing to make us think that it ſhall yet be otherwiſe. If you beleeve not this truth, you will have little benefit by

the next doctrine. The windes will be very high in the Church of God. This is evident in Scripture; however it be, this is our comfort; Theſe Windes if we be godly, will blow us fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to heaven; and the higher the Windes are, the neerer is the calme. Expect outward ſtorms. Expect inward tempeſts. Do not beleeve your ſelves to be paſt either of theſe. Our former ſtorms may perhaps prove calm weather, if they be compared with our future tempeſts. Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for them will be no prejudice if they never come. When you are out of one temptation, look for another before Antichriſts utter down-fall.</p>

               <item>2. What it is of theirs that Chriſt hides.</item>
               <item>3. Why Chriſt is a hiding place to them.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. There are ſeveral things in Jeſus Chriſt which make up this hiding place<hi>:</hi> indeed every thing in Chriſt is a hiding place. I ſhall inſtance in ſome.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The providence of Chriſt.</hi> The Scripture tells us that <hi>the eyes of the Lord runne to and fro thoroughout the earth,</hi> 2 Chron. 16. 9. Jeſus Chriſt hath the ſame watchful eyes of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:38484:58"/>
over his people that the Father hath, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 17. By him all things conſiſt. It's one Argument Divines bring to prove Chriſts divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, becauſe be governs the world by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, as the Father doth, <hi>John</hi> 5. 17. <hi>My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.</hi> It's meant of his providential working. And <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. Chriſt is ſaid <hi>to uphold all things by the Word of his Power,</hi> which is an act of providence. Now as Chriſt by his providence watcheth over all things and and creatures; ſo do his eyes watch continually over his people. <hi>Eſay</hi> 27. 3. <hi>I the Lord do keep it,</hi> I will keep it night and day. This is one great ſtone of this biding place.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Attributes of Chriſt.</hi> All the Divine Attributes are aſcribed to Chriſt as well as to the Father. Eternity, <hi>Micah</hi> 5. 2. Almightineſſe, <hi>Eſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> 9. 6. Omniſcience, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 13. It's ſpoken of Chriſt our high Prieſt. Wiſdome, <hi>Prov.</hi> 9. 1. He is called God onely wiſe, <hi>Jude</hi> 25. All theſe Attributes are as ſo many ſtones that make this hiding place. <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. 10. <hi>The Name of the Lord is a ſtrong Tower.</hi> Chriſts name the Prophet men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Eſay</hi> 9. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>Wonderful, Counſellor, &amp;c.</hi> every one of theſe names is a room in this hiding place.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The Promiſes of Chriſt.</hi> All the promiſes of God are in Chriſt <hi>yea,</hi> and in him <hi>Amen,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 20. Chriſt hath purchaſed them; they all have their ratification and accompliſhment in Chriſt. The Scripture is full of promiſes of all ſorts; of protection, proviſion, deliverance, ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Every promiſe is a piece of this hiding-place. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 18. 30. <hi>The Word of the Lord is tryed.</hi> He is a buckler to them that truſt in him. Chriſts Word of Promiſe is the ſouls defence.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The merits of Christ.</hi> Chriſt hath by the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:38484:58"/>
ſhedding of his blood merited for his Elect whatſoever is neceſſary. Theſe merits are a beleevers hiding place. <hi>O my dove that art in the clefts of the rock,</hi> Cant. 2. 14. thoſe <hi>foramina petrae</hi> are <hi>vulnera Chriſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> There the beleever hides himſelf in the time of danger. As the dove when ſhe is purſued flies to her windows; ſo the beleever flies to the wounds of Chriſt, and there is hid.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>The interceſſion of Chriſt.</hi> The Scripture tells us that Chriſt appeares continually before the Father for us, he is ſtill moving for us at the right hand of God. His Interceſſion in heaven is the beleevers Sanctuary on earth. So the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle tells us in two places, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 18, 19, 20. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. He is able to ſave, &amp;c. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he lives for ever to make Interceſſion for us. Chriſt directs <hi>Peter</hi> to this, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 31.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What it is of a beleever that Chriſt is a hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding place unto.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Chriſt is a hiding place to the outward man.</hi> He hides that in time of ſtormes, Chriſt hides that two wayes.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) <hi>Sometimes he hides it from danger.</hi> He keeps his people from the rage of them that would ſwallow them. Thus the Church was hid, <hi>Rev,</hi> 12. 6. The woman fled into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, where ſhe hath a place prepared of God, that they ſhould feed her there one thouſand two hundred ſixty dayes. Thus <hi>David</hi> was often hid from the fury of <hi>Saul,</hi> and his Courtiers that ſought his life.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) <hi>Sometimes God hides it in danger.</hi> That though his people be in danger, yet they are not deſtroyed. Thus the Church was hid in <hi>Egypt.</hi> The buſh was burning, &amp; yet was not conſumed, <hi>Ex.</hi> 3. 2.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:38484:59"/>
2. <hi>Chriſt is a hiding place to the inward man.</hi> And herein he excells all other hiding pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p n="1">(1) <hi>He hides the ſoul from ſinne.</hi> The beſt of his people would ſinne more frequently, and more grievouſly, if Jeſus Chriſt did not hide them from ſin.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) <hi>He hides the ſoule from temptations.</hi> He chaines up Satan from tempting them, that he cannot bait them ſo furiouſly as he would; and when he ſuffers Satan to tempt, he doth not ſuffer them to be utterly overcome. Thus he was a hiding place to <hi>Peter,</hi> Luke 22. 31. Thus he was a hiding place to Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 12. 7. Though he did not hide him from being buffetted, yet he hid him from being vanquiſhed by thoſe buffettings.</p>
            <p n="3">(3) <hi>He hides their graces.</hi> Their faith, their hope, their patience, their humility, &amp;c. were not Chriſt a hiding place to their very graces; they would wither, they would die, they would come to nothing: he hides the root of grace, keeps that warme that it pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh not, yea he ſo hides it, as that he makes it fructifie.</p>
            <p n="4">(4) <hi>He hides their joy, their peace of conſcience.</hi> Our comforts have need of Chriſts protection, as well as our graces. Should not he be a hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our inward peace and joy; the winde of terrour and temptation would ſoone blow them away. <hi>In the world ye ſhall have tribulation, but in me ye ſhall have peace,</hi> John 16. 33. Our peace is built upon Chriſt, our peace is laid up in Chriſt, our peace is preſerved and defended by Chriſt. The Devil would ſoone quench our joy, if Chriſt were not a hiding place to it. Jeſus
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:38484:59"/>
Chriſt is in every place, and in every thing a hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding place to his people.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Why Chriſt is a hiding place to them. There is a double ground of it. Neceſſity. Convenience</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>It's neceſſary that Chriſt ſhould be their hiding place.</hi> This neceſſity is grounded upon a double conſideration.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Beleevers want a hiding place.</hi> They are expoſed to many enemies, to many dangers. The world, the devil, the fleſh are aſſailing, purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, making attempts upon them every day, and that ſeveral wayes. <hi>Luther</hi> was wont to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Church to a poor weak Virgin in a wilde Wilderneſſe, where there is nothing but ravenous creatures that ſeek her life. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours compariſon is ſomewhat like it, <hi>Lak.</hi> 10. 3. <hi>Behold, I ſend you forth as ſheep among wolves. Joſeph is a fruitful bough. The Archers have ſhot at him, &amp;c.</hi> Gen. 49. 23, 24, 25. Beleevers are in this world in a ſtrange land; they are not of the world, and therefore the world hates them. They want a hiding place for their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, for their ſoules, for their graces, for their comforts. The chicken doth not want the wing and the neſt, more then they do a hiding place.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>There is none other beſides Jeſus Chriſt that can be a hiding place for them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, they cannot be hiding places to themſelves. They are weak and fooliſh, they expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to danger; they know not well how to hide themſelves in Chriſt, much more unable are they to be protectors to themſelves. Should
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:38484:60"/>
Chriſt leave the beſt of us to our ſelves, we ſhould be our own Butchers, not Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectours.</p>
            <p>Secondly, no other creature can protect and hide them. Kings and Princes, they cannot hide us, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 146. 3. and if they cannot, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour men are much more unable. Horſes and Armies, they cannot be a hiding place to us, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 33. 16, 17. They are ſoon routed and ſcattered. If they could be hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding places to our bodies, yet ſurely to ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſoules they cannot. Gold and Silver cannot be a hiding place to us. Though men ſay to their wedge of Gold, thou art my confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, <hi>Job</hi> 31. 24. yet will not mountains of Gold and ſilver be ſafe hiding places in the day of trouble. The Holy Angels cannot be hiding places to us. They are but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>protectors; they do but ſpread Chriſts wings over us The truth is, all creatures want hiding places for themſelves. The beſt of creatures are but as the Dyal, they caſt no ſhadow unleſſe the Sunne ſhine upon them. The beſt of creatures is like <hi>Jonahs</hi> Gourd, the leaſt worm eats them thorough and thorough in a ſhort time.</p>
            <p n="2">II. There is Convenience as well as Neceſſity. It's very expedient that Chriſt ſhould be a hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding place to beleevers.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>he hath all qualifications</hi> that may fit him for this work.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>He hath ſtrength.</hi> A hiding place muſt be <hi>locus munitiſſimus.</hi> Paper houſes will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be good hiding places. Houſes made of reeds or rotten timber will not be fit places for men to hide themſelves in. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus

            <p n="4">4. <hi>Chriſt is faithful.</hi> He that will hide others, had need be very faithful. A falſe hearted Protector is worſe then an open purſuer; <hi>Will the men of Keilah deliver me up,</hi> ſaith <hi>David?</hi> They will deliver thee up, ſaith the Lord; but now Chriſt is faithful, <hi>Revelations</hi> 3. 14. He is the faithful wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; He cannot be bribed to ſurrender up any creature that comes to hide himſelf with him. Chriſt will die before he will betray his truſt.</p>

            <p>The Uſes are three Information. Exhortation. Conſolation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For Information. This conſiſts of foure Branches.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That Beleevers are Chriſto chari,</hi> very preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the eſteem of Chriſt. Beleevers are perſons of great worth. They are called excellent ones, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 3. They are more excellent then any perſons in the world beſides. They are flowers, roſes and lilies, the beſt of flowers, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 2.

They are precious ſtones, others are but common ſtones; They are light, others are darkneſſe. Their worth appeares by this, that Jeſus Chriſt hides them in times of danger. Men do not uſe to hide rubbiſh or lumber; but their jewels, their writings, things
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:38484:62"/>
of value. The Saints are the jewel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of Chriſt, they are the jewels of the Crown; Chriſt will loſe all, rather then one of theſe, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>They ſhall be mine in that day when I make up my jewels.</hi> They are Gods <hi>hidden ones,</hi> Pſal. 83. 3. Jeſus Chriſt will venture all the world to ſave one of his Saints. While he is able to protect himſelf, he will protect them; they are his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry members, a part of himſelfe; he keeps them with the ſame care he keeps himſelf. Wicked men look upon them as vile and mean things, but Chriſt accounts them his precious ones; he keeps the very number of their haires, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 30. It was aſigne that <hi>Jacob</hi> reſpected <hi>Rachel</hi> and <hi>Joſeph</hi> more then all the reſt of his houſhold, becauſe he was ſo careful of their preſervation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 2. He puts the handmaids and their children foremoſt, then <hi>Leah</hi> and her children, and then <hi>Rachel</hi> and <hi>Joſeph.</hi> If there be but one place of ſafety to be found in the world, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt wil put the beleever there. The Scripture ſaith, that <hi>Noah found favour in the eyes of the Lord,</hi> Gen. 6. 8. How is this grace of God to him evidenced? When all the world was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the violence of the deluge, God takes care to make an Ark for his preſervation. 'Tis a ſigne of the precious thoughts of Chriſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Saints, that he makes himſelfe a hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding place for their preſervation. Though they be never ſo meane in the eyes of men, they are incomparably precious in the eſteem of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>How impoſſible is it that any true beleever ſhould eternally periſh.</hi> The Scripture ſaith that they can never periſh, <hi>John</hi> 10. 28. They may ſeem to be loſt in the judgement of men, they may be
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:38484:63"/>
at loſt in their own apprehenſion, but they cannot be loſt. Amongſt other reaſons this is one, <hi>Christ hides them.</hi> Satan muſt ſtorme and level this hiding place before he can reach a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever to deſtroy him. The treaſury muſt be broken before the treaſure that is hid in it can be carried away, the jewels cannot be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way before the cheſt that keeps them be broken. The hiding place muſt be entred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that which is hidden in it be removed. Chriſt ſtands between his Elect and danger. The Devil muſt pierce Chriſt himſelf, before he can touch a Saint to deſtroy him. The beleever is hid in Chriſt, and Chriſt muſt ſuffer before he can ſuffer. Jeſus Chriſt did once conquer the devil for the beleevers freedome, and the devil muſt conquer Chriſt before he can finally over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the beleever.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>See here the al-ſufficiency of Chriſt.</hi> He is to his holy ones every thing they ſtand in need of. He is their life, he is their food, he is their rayment, and he is their hiding place. A hiding place is as neceſſary ſometimes as meat and cloathing. The Saints here are militant; they could not live if they were not hid. Though Chriſt were every thing elſe, yet if he were not an hiding place, he were not enough; but he is a hiding place as well as food. Jeſus Chriſt ſerves all the neceſſities of the ſoul. The Saints of God are in Scripture compared to ſheep, <hi>John</hi> 10. 14. Now a fold is as neceſſary for ſheep as paſtures; as the paſture preſerves them from ſtarving, ſo the fold preſerves them from wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying. Chriſt now is both fold and paſture. and ſo a ſufficient ſhepheard. The Church of Chriſt is compared to an Army, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6. 10. A

He doth not onely give them ammunition to fight when they are in the field, but he is a hiding place to them when they are heaten out of the field. The Church of Chriſt is compared to a ſhip, <hi>Eſay</hi> 54. 11. A ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is as neceſſary for a ſhip as either Maſts or Sailes, or Anchors. Jeſus Chriſt doth not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provide Sailes and Tackling for his ſhip, but he provides a Haven alſo; yea, he himſelf is the Haven; when his ſhip is weather-beaten by long voyages and ſharp ſtormes, he brings her into the Haven, and there ſhe's out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="4">4. <hi>The miſery of thoſe who are out of Christ.</hi> One great work of the Miniſtery is to diſcover the miſery of a Chriſtleſſe Condition. All un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleevers are without Chriſt. Though they be in Chriſt by outward profeſſion, yet they are without Chriſt in regard of ſaving union, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 12. The miſery of being unintereſſed in Chriſt is unſpeakable even in this regard, that he is without a hiding place. No greater em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme of miſery then to ſee a man in a ſharp ſtorm without a ſhelter. He that is without Chriſt hath neither ſhelter for ſoule nor body. When men aſſault him, when devils tempt him, when ſinne ſets upon him, he hath no place to retire to, where he can can have any ſecurity. He that is without Chriſt hath not one buſh to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him, either from men, devils, his own conſcience, or from the indignation of God.

A fear of providence becomes the people of God as well as others; but feare of anxiety or diſtruſt ſhould be far from them; wondrous confident have the Saints of God been in times of danger, upon this very ground. <hi>God is our refuge and ſtrength,</hi> ſaith the Church, <hi>a preſent help in time of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; therefore we will not fear though the earth be moved, &amp;c.</hi> Pſal. 46. 1, 2, 3.

'Tis a diſparagement to your hiding place, that you ſhould be afraid. If Chriſt be able to hide you, you ſhall not be undefended.

If Chriſt did not prepare a place for the <hi>woman, the Church,</hi> and if he did not give her the <hi>two wings of an Eagle to carry her to her hiding place,</hi> the Dragon would ſoon devoure both her and her childe, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 14.

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Take heed of making any other hiding places.</hi> Men are very apt when danger approacheth to dig created hiding places for themſelves. We may reade how the Prophet reproves this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, <hi>Eſay</hi> 22 9, 10, 11. A providential uſe of outward means, is not onely lawful, but neceſſary, but carnal truſting to any ſuch hiding place is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.

God will drive the wheeles over their own back. If men and horſes could be a hiding place from men to your bodies, they cannot be any competent ſhelters to your ſoules; they cannot hide the inner man.

            <p>Our Saviour heares this diſpute, and ſteps in with them in his own perſon.

2. <hi>Chriſt hath ability as well as authority.</hi> Whatſoever is requiſite for the healing of ſouls, is to be found in Jeſus Chriſt. This the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet expreſly affirmes, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4. 2. <hi>The Sunne of righteouſneſſe ſhall ariſe with healing in his wings.</hi> Healing is a large word; The Geneva tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on reades it, health ſhall be under his wings, Now there could not be health or healing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Chriſts wings, if there were not in him what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is neceſſary to health or ſpiritual healing.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That it hath pleaſed the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that in him ſhould all fulneſſe dwell,</hi> Col. 1. 19. Chriſt is a garden ſo well furniſhed, that there is in him every root and plant that is requiſite to make a ſpiritual medicine. He hath a purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vertue, a ſtrengthning vertue, a comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vertue, a cheering vertue, a quickning ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. There is that in him which is proper for all diſeaſes. The Evangeliſt tells us, that when ſick perſons reſorted to Chriſt in the days of his fleſh, there went vertue out of him, and healed them all, <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 19. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, no vertue could have gone out of him, if all vertue had not been treaſured up in him. Chriſt hath eye-ſalve for blinde eyes, mollifying grace for hard-hearts, enlivening grace for dead ſoules, humbling grace for proud minds. God hath given him fulneſs of all things neceſſary for ſick ſoules, and wiſdom to apply the ſame for the benefit of thoſe that repair to him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, how Chriſt heales ſpiritual Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>He heales by juſtification.</hi> Sinne brings guilt, <hi>Lev.</hi> 5. 2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 19. Every ſinne makes the creature liable to wrath. This guilt
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:38484:77"/>
is removed by the grace of juſtification. Jeſus Chriſt applies his ſpotleſſe and perfect righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe to the ſoule, and thereby actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly removes the guilt of ſinne, and makes the ſinner as pure in the ſight of God, as if he had never offended. Of this the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Romans</hi> 5. 18, 19. This is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Scripture the covering of ſinne, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. 1, 2. <hi>Bleſſed is the man whoſe unrighteouſneſſe is forgiven, and whoſe ſinne is covered.</hi> Chriſt draws the vaile or garment of his own merit and obedience over the ſpotted ſoule of a ſinner, and thereby covers all his guilt. In this reſpect a ſinner is perfectly healed. Though ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in him, yet the guilt is taken away, ſo that it ſhall never redound upon the perſon for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. Hence it is that God is ſaid, <hi>not to behold iniquity in his people,</hi> Numb. 23. 21. Of this healing the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 3. <hi>Who forgiveth all thine iniquities, who healeth all thy diſeaſes.</hi> Of this healing we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 20. <hi>The Lord hearken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Hezekiah, and healed the people.</hi> He did not reckon nor impute the guilt of that ſinne to the people.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>He heales the ſoule by ſanctification.</hi> Every ſinne hath filthineſſe in it as well as guilt. It is of a defiling nature, and leaveth defilement upon the ſoule of the ſinner, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 11. Hence it is that ſinners are ſaid to be filthy creatures, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 11. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14. 3. they are altogether become filthy. This is called <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> or <hi>labes peccati,</hi> the ſpot or ſtaine of ſinne. Corruption, pollution, &amp;c. It doth immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow every offence of ſinne, and remaines when the act of ſinne is over. Look as waters,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:38484:78"/>
when they break their banks and over-flow the earth, leave a filthy ſlime and ſediment behind them; ſo all ſinful acts leave upon the ſoule a filthy ſlime of corruption. This filthineſſe Jeſus Chriſt heales by Sanctification. He doth by his Spirit plant the ſeeds of grace in the heart; he doth make the ſoul partaker of the divine natu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. He doth cauſe all <hi>old things to paſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and all things to become new,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>6. He doth write his Lawes in the heart of the ſinner, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 33. He doth ſprinkle cleane water upon the ſinner, whereby he is cleanſed from all his defilements, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 25. And by this meanes the filthineſſe of ſinne is healed This Sanct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation hath two parts; the one is mortification, whereby the body of ſinne is waſted, <hi>Rom</hi> 8. 13. and <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 3, 5. The other is regeneration, or the ſpiritual reſurrection, whereby the inward man is ſtrengthened and renewed from day to day<hi>:</hi> the one is the putting off the old man, the other is the putting on the new man. Now although the ſinner is not healed perfectly, and at once of the filthineſſe of ſinne by Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as he is of the guilt of ſinne, in regard of juſtification, becauſe this is a real change, and therefore it's carried on ſucceſſively and gradual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whereas juſtification is onely a relative change, and therefore is perfect at once; yet he is in ſo ſure and certaine a way of healing, that Jeſus Chriſt will never let him go out of his hands till he be fully cured. He is perfectly healed in reſpect of parts already, and he ſhall be perfectly healed in reſpect of degrees; he ſhall ſee the day when there ſhall not be the leaſt ſpeck of ſinne or filth, either upon the ſoul or bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>

Thirdly, the excellency of this Phyſician a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other Phyſicians. This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in many reſpects.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>In regard of the Subject.</hi> Other Phyſicians have to deale onely with the body. All their buſineſſe lies in the temper, conſtitution, parts of the body, in preventing, removing diſeaſes that annoy the outward man. Their line reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no farther. The ſoule is not the object or ſubject of the Phyſicians Art. But now the chief part about which Chriſt is employed, is the ſoul, the conſcience, the affections, the inward man. He heales the diſtempers of the heart, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Phyſicians as Phyſicians can neither know, nor heal. <hi>Vid.</hi> Eſay <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>1. 1.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is a Phyſician for all diſeaſes.</hi> There are ſome diſeaſes which are <hi>opprobria me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicorum,</hi> no Phyſician in the world is able to cure them. But Jeſus Chriſt can cure all diſeaſes, all kindes of diſeaſes, and every individual diſeaſe. He knows the cauſe of every diſeaſe, and therefore he can cure all. Some Phyſicians, though they have a general skill in all diſeaſes, yet their excellency lies ſometimes in one or two which they have ſtudied more then others, and about which they have been imployed more then in others. As ſome Divines are better verſed in ſome one or two Controverſies then others, ſo, &amp;c. But Chriſt is as exact in all ſpiritual diſeaſes, as he is in any diſeaſe. He is as good for the diſeaſes in the head, as for thoſe that are in the heart; and for thoſe that are in the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as for thoſe that are in the head. He can cure ignorance, pride, unbelief, diſcontent, impatience, hardneſſe of heart, &amp;c. and he can
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:38484:79"/>
cure one as well as another, that is, he can cure all. Chriſt never yet met with a ſpiritual diſtemper, which he was not able to call by its right name, and to preſcribe a fit medicine for. It's ſaid of him in the Goſpel, That he cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all manner of diſeaſes, <hi>John</hi> 5. 4. He can cure all manner of ſpiritual diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Jeſus Christ can give no hurtful medicine.</hi> The moſt learned Phyſician in the world, being he knows but in part, may preſcribe ſomething which is not proper for the diſeaſe; unleſſe they had ſpectacles to ſee into the body, they may be miſtaken; but Chriſt cannot be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. He never appointed any thing but what was fit, yea, nothing but what was beſt for the patients condition. And indeed Chriſts Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick is therefore proper, becauſe he preſcribes it. Other Phyſicians appoint ſuch receipts, becauſe they are proper, but Chriſts receipts are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, becauſe he preſcribes them. If he will uſe a plaiſter of clay and ſpettle, it is therefore right, becauſe he will uſe it, <hi>John</hi> 9. 6. That which would have made a ſeeing man blinde, if it had been done by a man, will m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ke a blind man ſee when it is done by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt heales ſpeedily.</hi> Other Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians are long in healing; We uſe to ſay, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes come on horsback, but go away on foot. No Phyſician can cure in a moment. They muſt obſerve method. A cure over-ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened may be as prejudicial to the Patient as a diſeaſe neglected. But Chriſt can heal in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant. Many a diſeaſed ſinner, who hath la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured for many yeares under many ſpiritual diſtempers, have been cured by Jeſus Chriſt in a trice of time. We read in the Goſpel, that
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:38484:79"/>
Chriſt did immediately cure ſome that had la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured a long time under diſeaſes, in a moment. <hi>Take up thy bed and walk,</hi> Vid. <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 3. <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately</hi> his leproſie was healed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 34. <hi>immediately</hi> their eyes received ſight, <hi>Mar.</hi> 1. 31. <hi>immediately</hi> the feaver left her; many inſtances of like nature. Immediate cures are not the Acts of creatures, though never ſo learned, though never ſo wiſe. Many a dead, lame, blinde, impenitent ſinner hath come ſick into the Church, and gone out whole. When Chriſt pleaſes, he can heal preſently.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Chriſt can bleſſe his Phyſick.</hi> He can make it effectual for what he pleaſeth. No Phyſician in the world is able to do it. He applies Phyſick, but he cannot ſay this ſhall cure it. He muſt ſeek a bleſſing from Chriſt. The efficacy of that which other Phyſicians preſcribe, doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the ſutableneſſe of it, and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally upon Chriſts bleſſing; but the efficacy of Chriſts Phyſick depends upon his Application. Chriſt can ſay peremptorily, I will remove ſuch a ſpiritual diſtemper. The Leper acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this, <hi>Math.</hi> 8. 2. <hi>Lord if thou wilt, thou canſt make me cleane.</hi> I will, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Be thou clean, &amp;c.</hi> He hath all ſpiritual diſeaſes at his beck. The Centurion acknowledgeth it, <hi>Do but ſpeak the word, and my ſervant ſhall be healed, &amp;c.</hi> Mat. 8. 8. If Chriſt ſay to impenitency, to unbeliefe, &amp;c. <hi>Be healed,</hi> they will be healed; If Chriſt ſay, I will by ſuch a Sermon heale ſuch a ſinner, the work will be done. His Word is cure enough for any diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>Chriſt heales the poor as well as the rich.</hi> Many Phyſicians do not care to take poor pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients in hand; but Jeſus Chriſt is as willing to
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:38484:80"/>
viſit and heale the poor as well as the rich. He is as ready to go to the beggar on the dunghil, as to the King on the Throne. Jeſus Chriſt in the dayes of his fleſh, was as ready to heal the ſervant as the Maſter, <hi>Luke</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>8. 35, 36. the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ignoble, the great and the ſmall are all alike to him. Chriſt looks not at outward qualities, but at ſpiritual diſtempers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſt heales all freely.</hi> Other Phyſicians take rewards. 'Tis their calling, and they ought to live upon their calling. Many of them are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry exacting. If they have not a daily fee, they care not for viſiting. The Goſpel ſpeaks of one that had ſpent all her living on Phyſicians, <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 43. But now Chriſt takes nothing from his Patients, whether they be rich or poore. He gives them their Phyſick freely. Nay, he gives rewards to all his Patients. Other Phyſicians receive from their Patients, but here the Patient receives from the Phyſician. He provides meat, drink, attendance for all his Patients. Chriſt is a nurſe as well as a Phyſician. You may ſee this in that Parable, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 34, 35. Phyſicians are not bound to take care of their Patients in this ſence, but Chriſt doth.</p>
               <p>8. <hi>Chriſt offers himſelf.</hi> Other Phyſicians ſtay till they be ſent for. No ſick man expects a Phyſician till he be called; he is glad if he can ſee him then; but Chriſt comes without calling; indeed he ſhould never come if he did not come without a call. The ſick ſoule would die before he would ſend for Chriſt. Other Phyſicians are intreated to come to the ſick, but here the ſick are intreated to come to the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 28. The work of the Miniſtery is to beſeech ſinners that they would be heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

               <p>9. <hi>Chriſt doth not depart though he be reviled, &amp;c.</hi> Other Phyſicians they abſent themſelves if they be unkindly uſed. Who would expect a Phyſician ſhould come daily to one that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches and reviles him, yea, to one that ſhuts the door on him when he comes, much leſſe to one that beats him, &amp;c? The ſick ſinner uſeth Chriſt uncivilly, diſcourteouſly; he frownes on him, he ſhuts the door on him, he reviles him, he beates him, and ſtones him, and yet the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician will not depart; though he ſeem to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and to withdraw for a time, yet returnes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. Chriſt will put up a thouſand abuſes, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then ſuffer one of his Elect to die in their ſinnes. Though Chriſt ſee that we throw his phyſick into his face, that we teare and burn his bills in his preſence; that we ſend for Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyricks and prefer their advice before his, yet he waits with patience, and will not be driven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by the worſt uſage.</p>
               <p>10. <hi>Chriſt himſelfe is the ſick mans Phyſick.</hi> Other Phyſicians do not heal their patients with their own fleſh, but Chriſt doth. Other Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians do ſometimes take away the blood of their patients, but Chriſt lets himſelf blood to heal his patients. <hi>By his ſtripes we are healed, Eſay</hi> 53. 5. Chriſt makes a wound in himſelf to heale our wounds. The Phyſician dies to ſave the patients life from the grave. <hi>To him that loved us, and waſhed away our ſinnes with his blood,</hi> Rev. 1. 5. Neither the guilt nor filth of one ſin would have been removed, if the Phyſicians blood had not been ſhed for it.</p>

                     <p>2. Let Chriſt alone with the cure, he goes the ſafeſt way, yea, he goes the neereſt way, when he ſeems to go the fartheſt way.</p>
                     <p>3 <hi>Take notice of the alſufficiency of Chriſt.</hi> He is every thing to the ſoule which it wants. The ſoul wants bread, Chriſt is that; the ſoule wants drink, Chriſt is that; the ſoule wants ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Chriſt is that; the ſoul wants a ſhadow, Chriſt is that; the ſoul wants a Phyſician, and Chriſt is a Phyſician; not a Mountebank, but a learned skilful Phyſician. The ſoule that hath Chriſt hath every thing. One Jeſus Chriſt is enough for all the Neceſſities of the ſoule.</p>
                     <p>4. <hi>What comfort is this for the children of God!</hi> We get new falls every day, we breed new diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes every day. We contract new guilt, new filth. Chriſt is a Phyſician, he hath healing in his wings; he can cure your deadneſſe, your dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, your hardneſſe, your blindneſſe, &amp;c. He is a compaſſionate Phyſician. He is touched with the ſenſe of your infirmities, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 15. Get nearer and nearer to Chriſt, get farther under his healing wings, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>5. <hi>Rob not Chriſt of the honour of this Doctrine.</hi> Chriſt is robbed of the honour of a Phyſician, two wayes.</p>

1. When we go to other Phyſicians. To crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to duties, to carnal mirth, &amp;c. all which are Phyſicians of no value.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When we attribute our ſpiritual healing to our ſelves, or any creature, and not to Chriſt. He that robs Chriſt of the honour of a Phyſician, ſhall when he is ſick, perhaps, want a Phyſician.</p>
                     <p>Doct. 3. <hi>That there are many ſick of this ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al diſeaſe, who think themſelves to be whole.</hi> As in regard of the body, many that are very full of diſeaſes judge themſelves to be healthy and ſtrong, ſo very many there are who are mortal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſick of ſpiritual maladies, and yet conceive themſelves to be in perfect health. As many that are ſpiritualy healed think themſelves ſick unto death; ſo many that are ſpiritually ſick unto death, judge themſelves to be in a healthful eſtate. Thus it was with the vain glorious Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 11. he thought himſelf perfectly in health, when as he was ready to drop into his grave; yea, to fall into hell through the abundance of his ſpiritual ſickneſſes. Thus it was with thoſe other Phariſees; <hi>John</hi> 9. 39 40. Our Saviour hints their ſad condition to them, <hi>v.</hi> 9. They imagin'd themſelves unconcern'd in what was ſpoken. <hi>Are we alſo blinde? q. d.</hi> our eyes are as cleare as the eyes of any in the world, we are far from blindneſſe. They thought themſelves to ſee as perfectly as any, <hi>v.</hi> 40. Thus was it with the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> Rev. 3. 17. ſhe thought her condition as good as the beſt in the world, when ſhe was indeed as ſad a ſpectacle as the earth bore. Experience ſhews it to be ſo ſtill, and that with the greateſt part of men in the world.

                     <p>But whence comes this to paſſe? I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce all to theſe heads or ſprings.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Ignorance.</hi> The greateſt part of men are groſſely ignorant of their ſpiritual eſtate. They know not, they do not underſtand their inward eſtate. The Scripture tells us that a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal condition is an ignorant condition, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 18. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1 14 A carnal heart is ſpiritually an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and blinde heart. The ſtate of nature is called a ſtate of darkneſſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18. And a ſtate of folly, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5. 23. And all ſuch men are called ſpiritual fooles, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 14. 1. They may know much in outward things, they may know much of the letter of the Scripture, but as to ſaving knowledge, they are very ignorant, and without underſtanding. And as they are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of other matters, ſo they are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of their ſpiritual condition. This igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is to be aſcribed to theſe four heads.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>They want the Spirit of God.</hi> The holy Spirit is the principle of all ſaving light. It is called by the Apoſtle, <hi>The Spirit of wiſdome and revelation,</hi> Eph. 1. 17. becauſe all true wiſdom and ſaving illumination is the work of the Spirit; the Spirit gives us power to diſcern, and light wherby to ſee ſpiritual things. Pregnancy of natural wit without the Spirit of God, can never make a perſon wiſe unto ſalvation. <hi>Elihu</hi> tells <hi>Job, Chap.</hi> 32. 8. There is a ſpirit in man, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:38484:83"/>
of the Almighty giveth him wiſdome. He that wants this ſpirit cannot poſſibly know his ſpiritual eſtate. But now many men, all unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate men want this Spirit, <hi>Ergo.</hi> This the Apoſtle largely diſputes, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>They do not ſearch into their own hearts.</hi> He that would know his ſpiritual condition, muſt carefully and conſcionably dive into his own ſpirit by ſerious examination of himſelfe. He muſt turne his eyes inward. This the Apoſtle tells us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. <gap reason="foreign">

We muſt prove our ſelves as the Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith doth his metal, whether it be right or not; we muſt caſt our hearts into the fire, and bring them to the touchſtone, &amp;c. He that is not a ſelf-viſitor, a ſelf-examiner, can never attaine to any competent knowledge of himſelfe. Now there are many men, who never did ſpend one houre in the trial of themſelves, they are as great ſtrangers to their own hearts, as they are to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne Countreys, this makes them ignorant.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>They do not conſult with this ſpiritual Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt is the great principal Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician.

'Tis not onely to be underſtood of publick preaching, but of private conference. They are to diſcover their ſpiritual ſtate to the Miniſters of Chriſt, that they may help them in knowing what they do not underſtand, and in healing thoſe diſtempers which they have diſcovered: we are

As they help men by the direction of the Word of God, to know what they are to do, and what they are to beleeve; ſo they may be very beneficial by comparing the ſpiritual ſtare of men with the rule to help them to a better, and more perfect knowledge of themſelves then they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. But now the greateſt part of men neglect this. Men generally go to the Lawyer to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed about their outward ſtate, they go to the bodily Phyſician to be helped in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their corporal eſtate; but they never make conſcience of enquiring of the eſtate of their ſouls at the month of the ſpiritual Phyſician. This makes them ſo ignorant; and becauſe they are ignorant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they think their condition to be good when it's bad and miſerable.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Pride.</hi> Man is naturally a very proud ſwelling creature, willing to ſee what may make him excellent, unwilling to acknowledge any thing in himſelfe that may render him contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible, either in his own eyes, or in the eyes of others. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> the Sorcerer gave out that himſelf was ſome great one, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 9. he would be <gap reason="foreign">

<pb facs="tcp:38484:84"/>
diſeaſe. How comes it to paſſe elſe that men are ſo impatient to bear rebuke, that they are ſo unwilling to be inſtructed, that they are ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe to have their ſpiritual condition ſearched, that they are ſo raging under affliction? Is it not becauſe of that pride and conceitedneſſe that is in their hearts. Hence alſo it is, that though they beſick unto death; yet they judge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be in a ſound, healthy, ſaving conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, leſt by acknowledging their ſpiritual ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, they ſhould be laid low in the thoughts of men. See how proudly the Jewes ſpeak to Chriſt, when he would convince them of their ſpiritual bondage, <hi>John</hi> 8. 33. <hi>We are Abrahams children, and how ſayeſt thou, ye ſhall be made free?</hi> They thought it a mighty injury to a people of their quality, to be told of bondage and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. 'Tis want of humility that makes ſinful men hold ſuch groundleſſe concluſions about that their ſpiritual welfare.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Love of caſe.</hi> Men naturally love their eaſe and quiet. They would not be diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Iſſachar</hi> law that reſt was good, and therefore he coucheth down between two bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, <hi>Gen</hi> 49. 14, 15. Moſt men are for ſpirituals, as <hi>Iſſachar</hi> was for his outward condition; they prefer an unſafe reſt before a ſafe unquietneſſe. They know that if they once ſee, or acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge themſelves to be ſpiritually ſick; they muſt enter into a courſe of ſpiritual Phyſick. They muſt take down many a bitter potion which they do not like, therefore they conclude they are whole. As it is with many fooliſh men in regard of their bodies; though they be ſick of many diſeaſes, yet they had rather ſay, they are well, then meddle with Phyſick; they willingly caſt the
<pb facs="tcp:38484:85"/>
thoughts of their diſeaſes behind their back, that they may not be at the trouble and coſt of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. Juſt ſo it is with ſpiritual ſick men. If they ſhould ſay they are ſick, then they muſt make uſe of meanes. They muſt pray, they muſt repent, their ſinnes muſt be purged out, they muſt have ſome ſpiritual diſturbance, &amp;c. This they love not, therefore they conclude they are whole, and often drop down into hell, before they will acknowledge that they ſtand in need of Phyſick. <hi>Soul take thy eaſe,</hi> ſaith that rich foole in the Goſpel, <hi>eat, drink, &amp;c.</hi> Luke 12. 19. This love of <hi>painful eaſe</hi> (for ſo it will prove in the end) is the bane and ruine of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of ſouls.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>They judge of their ſpiritual ſtate by falſe Rules.</hi> 'Tis very ſad to conſider what ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, rotten foundations men build hopes of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon. Our Saviour ſpeaks of two ſorts of builders in the Goſpel, under which all the Sons of men are comprehended: the one builds his houſe upon, a rock, the other upon the ſand, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7, 24, 25, 26, 27. Every man is a build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and every man builds his ſalvation, either upon the rock, or upon the ſand. Moſt men build upon the ſand, conclude themſelves to be well upon ſuch arguments as will not hold in the day of trial. I ſhall both diſcover them, and ſhew the rottenneſſe of them.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Falſe Rule. <hi>Freedome from ſcandalous flagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſinnes.</hi> Many men think they are ſpiritually whole, becauſe they are not ſick of thoſe viſible deſperate diſeaſes which other ſinners have up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. They are neither thieves, nor whores, nor drunkards, nor oppreſſors, nor chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, nor murtherers, &amp;c. They live ſoberlie,

This was the ground of that misjudgment which the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee made of himſelfe, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 11. <hi>God I thank thee, that I am not as other men, &amp;c.</hi> It's very like the Phariſee ſpake no more then what was true, for they were generally men very inoffenſive as to all ſuch things.

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>'Tis a very great mercy to be freed from theſe ſcandalous ſinnes.</hi> If God have preſerved you from theſe viſible diſeaſes, that you have none of theſe botches of <hi>Egypt</hi> upon you, it is to be acknowledged as a very great bleſſing. The Phariſee did not amiſſe in bleſſing God that he was no Extortioner, if he had done it upon a right ground; if he had not gone on to cenſure the Publican, he had not been blamed, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for it. <hi>David</hi> bleſſes God for preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him from the ſinne of murther upon <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bigails</hi> perſwaſion. <hi>Vid.</hi> 1 <hi>Samuel</hi> 25. 32, 33.

This is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rule whereby carnal Profeſſours judge their condition to be good. They have been baptized, they have come to Gods Table, they have lived in the Church, &amp;c. therefore ſurely they are in a very healthful conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I have four things to ſay for this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>'Tis a great honour to be a member of the Church though it be onely by viſible Profeſſion.

The Church of God is the moſt honourable ſociety upon earth, Such as are the members of the Church are neerer to God then any others. They enjoy ſuch priviledges as none elſe enjoy. They have more helps to ſalvation then any others. We can never be ſufficiently thankful for this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>To pray, and to hear, and to frequent the publick Ordinances, &amp;c. is that which all that hope to be ſaved, are to do.</hi> That man is in a bad eſtate that ſlights theſe duties. The wrath of the Lord lies upon them that do not call upon the Name of the Lord, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. 25. He that wilfully neglects theſe, can never be ſaved, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14. 14. not to call upon God, is the character of a worker of iniquity.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p n="1">(1.) <hi>There are many instances in Scripture to prove this.</hi> Was not <hi>Iſhmael</hi> circumciſed? was not he a member of the Church? <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 16. and yet without any ſaving intereſt in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.

What think you of <hi>Saul, Ahab,</hi> and all thoſe wicked men? did not they live in the Church? did they not obſerve outwardly the worſhip of God? and yet the ſonnes of <hi>Belial.</hi> In the new Teſtament, did not the Publicans faſt and pray, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 12. Was not <hi>Judas</hi> a Diſciple? did not he preach as well as others? and yet a child of perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Was not <hi>Simon Magus</hi> baptized? <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 13.

                     <p n="2">(2.) <hi>God takes men off in Scripture from reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon this.</hi> And that both in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and in the New. In the Old Teſtament, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 4. In the New Teſtament, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 9. Now for a man to make that an Argument of a good condition, which God ſaith is no Argument, is to no purpoſe.</p>
                     <p n="3">(3.) <hi>Our Saviour, tells that many will plead</hi>

                        <hi>this, at the day of judgement in vaine,</hi> Luke 13. 26. 27.</p>
                     <p n="4">(4) <hi>A man cannot be a hypocrite, till he do all theſe things.</hi> A hypocrite may pray, and faſt, and heare as often, and as well externally, as a ſincere Chriſtian, <hi>Eſay</hi> 58. 3. and more plainly, <hi>Eſay</hi> 48. 1, 2. <hi>lege.</hi> Therefore the bare perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of theſe duties, doth not argue a man to be in a good condition.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. And laſtly, <hi>yet may a perſon from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of theſe duties evidence himſelf to be in a good condition God-ward, when he doth performe them according to thoſe Rules which the Word of God layes down.</hi> I ſhall reduce them to three Heads.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>When holy diſpoſitions are brought with us to duties.</hi> Several diſpoſitions the Word of God requires in every duty.</p>
                     <p n="1">(1) <hi>Holy feare and reverence of God.</hi> Of this <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>In thy feare will I wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip towards thy holy Temple.</hi> 'Tis meet the heart ſhould be poſſeſſed with an holy reverential awe of God, when it comes before him in any du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 28. The diſtance that is between God and man, the conſideration of that pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution that is upon the ſoules of the beſt, ſhould breed this reverence: We cannot ſanctifie God, if this feare be not in our hearts, <hi>Eſay</hi> 8. 12. Now that man that can finde ſuch a diſpiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in his heart, when he comes to heare, or to pray, may conclude that there is a principle of grace in his heart. Though bare hearing, and bare praying will not argue our eſtate to be good; yet trembling at the hearing of the Word, and a filial awe of God upon the heart in prayer, will evince a ſpiritual principle.</p>

Now though bare prayer will be no Argument of a good condition, yet praying in godly humility will, if it be from the heart, if it be from a deep ſpiritual ſenſe of our own vileneſſe. If our ſouls lie in the duſt before the Lord, when we come to worſhip him; ſuch worſhip will argue grace.</p>

He that cometh unto God muſt beleeve, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. Now when in hearing we can cloſe with God by applying what we hear, when in prayer we are able in ſome meaſure to caſt our ſelves upon God, to rely and depend on him for audience, for acceptance; When we can pray as <hi>David</hi> ſaith to God, and look up for an anſwer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5. 3. ſuch diſpoſitions in duties are Arguments of a work of grace upon the heart.</p>

                     <p n="1">(1) <hi>Obedience to the Divine command.</hi> When a perſon ſhall upon ſerious examination finde that his end in praying, hearing, &amp;c. is, that he may ſhew his ſubjection to the Divine Precept. He prayes not onely becauſe he wants ſome mercy, but becauſe he would honour God by performing his Commands. When a perſon can ſay with <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119 4, 5. <hi>Thou hast commanded, &amp;c.</hi> He may from the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ſuch ſervices comfortably conclude, that there is a principle of grace in his heart. When we can appeale to God, that we wait upon his Ordinances, becauſe we would do that duty we owe to God; in ſuch caſe, we may argue from duties to grace.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2) <hi>A deſire to get and keep communion with God.</hi> This is one end for which holy duties are appointed, that by them God and the ſoule may come together. And this hath been the end which holy men have propounded to themſelves in holy duties, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27. 4. <hi>Thy face Lord will I ſeek.</hi> Thus it was with <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 42. 2. <hi>When ſhall I come to appeare before God?</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63. 2. <hi>To ſee thy power, and thy glory, ſo as I have ſeen thee in the Sanctuary.</hi> Now when a perſon can in the uprightneſſe of his ſoul ſay, that his end in coming to duties, publick and private, is becauſe <hi>he would ſee him whom his ſoule loveth;</hi> and therefore he is not ſatisfied with a duty, if he meet not with God in it, he may then comfortably conclude from the

performing of duties, a principle of grace in his heart.</p>
                     <p n="3">(3.) <hi>A deſire to get corruption weakned, and grace ſtrengthened.</hi> This is one end why God hath inſtituted his Ordinances, that ſinne may be outed thereby, and grace confirmed. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2. Now when a perſon can in the integrity of his ſoule ſay, that he prays, heares, &amp;c. that he may get love increaſed, faith confirmed, grace exerciſed; that he may get his heart warmed, his conſcience purified; then he may comfortably conclude from ſuch duties, that his heart is upright with God.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, <hi>When the doing of duties make you fruitful.</hi> When you heare, and give up your ſelves to be ruled by the Word you heare, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 17.

But if theſe things be not in you in ſome degree and meaſure; the bare performance of duties, though they he done never ſo frequently, never ſo exactly as to the outwards of them, will be no ground to you, for the reaſons above menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, that you are in a good condition. This is the ſecond falſe Rule.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The third falſe Rule; <hi>Outward Proſperity.</hi> Multitudes of men judge of their ſpiritual condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the Rule of outward Proſperity. They think their ſoules are in health, becauſe their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are in health; they think they are inwardly proſperous, becauſe they are outwardly happy. They have great revenues, a full trading, they have a multitude of children, their flocks and their heards are increaſed, they are advanced to great honours; therefore they bleſſe themſelves and ſay, God loves them, and they are highly in his favour. They think they are the heires of heaven, becauſe they are the poſſeſſors of the earth. Thus it was with the ten tribes<hi>:</hi> when the Prophets threatned the judgements of God againſt them for their ſinnes, they ran to this Sanctuary to ſecure themſelves, they concluded Gods ſpecial favour from outward proſperity. <hi>Vid.</hi> Hoſ. 12. 8. 'Tis the general and common refuge of worldly men. They think their hearts are full of grace, becauſe their purſes are full of gold; becauſe the world dandles them upon
<pb facs="tcp:38484:93"/>
her lap, they think God dandles them upon his knee. For the removal of this, I ſhall propound four things.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>'Tis a mercy in it ſelf to enjoy a competency of theſe outward things.</hi> To have health, wealth, proſperitie, plentie, is a mercy to be received with much thankfulneſſe from God. To be poore, ſicklie, weak is in it ſelfe an evil; and to be rich, ſtrong, healthful, is in its own nature a bleſſing; which I ſhall prove by theſe two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>The Scripture puts outward proſperity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt bleſſings.</hi> Deut. 28. 3, 4, 5, to 15. So <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. 3, 4, &amp;c. Now what the Scripture calls bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, is in its own nature a bleſſing. The judgment of God is according to truth.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Thoſe which are rich, &amp;c. have more oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of doing good, then ſuch as are poore.</hi> They may by their outward eſtates promote Religion, help to advance the worſhip of God in the world, be inſtruments of planting the Goſpel in forreigne parts. A good purſe and a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous heart meeting together, may be very inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental ſundry wayes for the glory of God, and the good of men. They may be the meanes of bringing in many to God, both by their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which is very prevalent in the world, and by giving unto men rewards for godlineſſe ſake. One rich man in a Pariſh may be a great help to make a Pariſh Religious, if not in heart, yet in profeſſion; which is a great mercy. Rich men have a capacity of doing that good, which men of meaner condition want. They may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve priſoners, cloath the naked, feed the hungry, ranſome captives, which other men cannot do. Now it's a mercy to be put
<pb facs="tcp:38484:93"/>
into a capacity of doing good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap> a good man, when he is not capable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap> the good he would, though it be but a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral good. 'Tis a greater trouble to a good man not to be able to give, then it is to the poore to be turned away without giving. Though in ſuch caſe the liberality of the heart is accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inſtead of the liberality of the hand. He that would give when he hath not to give, is ſet down in Gods Kalendar, for a bountiful man, though he give nothing at all. This is the firſt concluſion.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Riches and grace do ſometimes go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</hi> Outward Proſperity and inward do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times meet in the ſame perſon. 'Tis not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that rich men ſhould be good men. We have ſome inſtances of this in Scripture. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was very holy, <hi>Called the righteous man,</hi> Eſay 41. 2. <hi>the Father of the faithful, The friend of God, &amp;c.</hi> and yet <hi>Abraham</hi> was very rich, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 35. <hi>Job</hi> was exceeding pious, a man whom God boaſts of to Satan, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 8. and yet he was very rich. He had plenty of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren (thoſe are firſt put in the inventory) and he was rich in all other wealth, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. he had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thouſand ſheep, three thouſand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred ſhe aſſes, and a very great houſhold, and <hi>Chap. ult.</hi> when his eſtate is ſurveyed againe, you will finde it doubled, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. many other inſtances we have in Scripture of the Aſſociation of grace and greatneſſe. This God doth for theſe ſix Reaſons.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>To confute the judgement of the world.</hi> Plain dealing is a jewel ſaith the world, but he that uſeth it will die a beggar. God gives theſe
<pb facs="tcp:38484:94"/>
things to his people, to croſſe that wicked Proverb.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>To convince men that they are not evil things.</hi> It was <hi>Auſtins</hi> Obſervation long ſince. God beſtowes outward things upon the worſt of men, that they may not be thought to be the onely good things; and he beſtowes them ſometimes upon his own people, that they may not be thought to be evil things.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>To ſhew his Dominion and right of diſpoſing even theſe outward things.</hi> Should not ſome godly men enjoy theſe outward things, they would be apt to think that God did not meddle with things of this nature, but now the confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of theſe things upon the godly diſproves that Atheiſm.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>To let men ſee, even ſenſual men, that it is not in vaine to ſerve God</hi> Worldly men ſay, what profit ſhall we have if we pray to him? <hi>Job</hi> 21. 15. Now they are not capable of underſtanding the inward profit of holineſſe, but they can underſtand the outward advantages. God therefore will prove the profit of piety by ſuch Arguments as they are able to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>To fulfill the letter of his Promiſe.</hi> He hath promiſed theſe outward things to godly men, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112. 2, 3. Now men would queſtion his faithfulneſſe in keeping promiſe, if it ſhould not ſometimes be made good in kinde.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>God makes ſome of his people rich to help ſuch as are poor.</hi> Wicked men generally hate the people of God for their very holineſſe. They are not willing to relieve them, though God by his power makes them Authours of good

to them. Therefore that, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                        </gap> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake, God is pleaſed to make ſome of their number great, that the wicked of the world may not alwaies tread them down without oppoſition. <hi>Joſeph</hi> was made great, to provide for his fathers houſe in their povertie, <hi>Gen.</hi> 50. 20. God makes ſome of his flock rich and great, that the poor of his flock may have ſome to look after them for his ſake. This is the ſecond Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>That grace and holineſſe is the beſt and neereſt way to attaine to all outward proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> For although God as ſoveraigne Lord, make rich and poor, whom he pleaſe; yet no man can expect or hope for temporal felicitie but the man that is truly godly, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. <hi>Godlineſſe hath the promiſe of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.</hi> And <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 5. The froward do often enjoy much of theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, but the promiſe of the inherit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of them belongs onely to the meek, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 16. Riches and honour are put into the hand of wiſdome, and none but wiſdomes children can upon any good ground ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to inherit either of them. This is the third.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>That the enjoyment of theſe outward things, is no infallible evidence of a good condition.</hi> 'Tis poſſible for a man to poſſeſſe a great por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of outward happineſſes, and yet be unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in regard of his ſoule. The purſe may be full of gold, and yet the heart emptie of ſaving grace. The body may be fat and in good liking, and yet the ſoule leane and withered. A man may have great poſſeſſions in the world, and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:38484:95"/>
yet have no intereſt in God. Our Saviour ſuppoſeth this, <hi>Matthew</hi> 16. 26. There are foure things required to make up this ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
                     <p n="1">(1) A man that gaines the whole world muſt enjoy all the riches, honour, pleaſure of worldly things.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2) He muſt have a heart capable to take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in all theſe.</p>
                     <p n="3">(3) He muſt enjoy all theſe from the firſt man to the laſt man, from the beginning to the end of the world.</p>
                     <p n="4">(4) Freedome from all vexations, and troubles of Spirit. This no man ever did enjoy. And yet our Saviour ſuppoſeth, that a man may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy all this, and yet loſe his ſoule. That outward proſperitie cannot evidence a man to be in a ſtate of grace, appeares by theſe ſeven Arguments.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>They are beſtowed upon the worſt of men.</hi> The Scripture tells us of many rich men, very rich, that lived and died wickedlie. What think you of him mentioned, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. He was exceeding rich, his treaſury was too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, his ſtore-houſe was too ſmall for his reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, and yet no intereſt in God at all that might entitle him to ſalvation; a very foole for all his ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

There are all expreſſions of proſperity that can be imagined, and yet <hi>v.</hi> 23. that very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is in Hell torments. You know the ſtory of <hi>Nabal,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 2, 6. he was very wealthie, and yet a ſinful fool. As his name is, ſo is he, <hi>Nabal</hi> is his name, and follie is with him. You reade of ſome in <hi>Job, Chap.</hi> 21. 7, 8, 9, 10. that enjoyed much proſperitie, and yet deſperatelie
<pb facs="tcp:38484:95"/>
wicked: reade <hi>v.</hi> 14. <hi>They ſay <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                              <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                           </gap> Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> were very rich, it was a land fruitful as the Garden of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13. 10. and yet they that poſſeſſed that fruitful land, are now ſuffering the vengeance of eternal fire. <hi>Jude</hi> 7. The Scripture is full of ſuch examples.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Riches and honour are but common bleſſings.</hi> They are the good things of the <hi>Foot-ſtool,</hi> not the good things of the <hi>Throne.</hi> They are in the left hand of wiſdome, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 16. Now no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon mercie can argue ſpecial love, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9. 1. <hi>No man knows either love or hatred by any thing that is before him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Outward proſperity is very often a hindrance of ſalvation.</hi> That of our Saviour would ſeriouſly be taken notice of. <hi>'Tis eaſier for a camel to go thorough the eye of a needle, then for a rich man to enter into the Kingdome of God,</hi> Mat. 19. 24. Riches too often draw the heart from God, they coole zeale, quench devotion. We ſee by experience many men that were hot for Religion when they were poore, are grown dead, cold, now they have got eſtates. Our Saviour tells us, that the deceitfulneſſe of riches choaks the Word, and makes the heart unfruitful, <hi>Vid. Mat.</hi> 13. 22. Now that which hinders men from ſalvation, can be no argument of a ſtate of ſalvation.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Men may tranſmit riches to their poſterity.</hi> Now that which a man may have by deſcent and natural generation, can be no evidence of a ſtate of grace. No man is born in a ſtate of grace, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>A man muſt be borne againe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he can ſee the Kingdome of Heaven,</hi> Joh. 3. 3. Many men are borne rich and honourable,
<pb facs="tcp:38484:96"/>
&amp;c. therefore none of theſe things can entitle a man to heaven.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>If outward proſperity were an Argument of grace, then Covetouſneſſe would be no ſinne.</hi> 'Tis no ſinne but duty, for a man to labour for, and to covet evidences of grace. We are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to do ſo in Scripture; <hi>Make your cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and election ſure,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 10. but covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is not a duty, but a ſinne, a ſinne of a high nature, <hi>The root of all evil,</hi> ſo the Apoſtle calls it, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 10. 'Tis idolatrie, one of the worſt kinds of idolatry.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Outward proſperity may be quite loſt.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it can be no evidence of a ſtate of grace. Evidences of true grace can never totally be loſt where once they are; the knowledge of the evidence may be loſt, but the ground of the evidence cannot be loſt; but all outward proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity may be loſt. <hi>Riches are not for ever,</hi> Prov. 27. 24. Honours die before he that had them die. <hi>Haman</hi> will be an example of that; our own age hath given us freſh precedents in abundance, of the periſhingneſſe of theſe things. Do not many that were cloathed in skarlet em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the dung-hil? Are not rich men made poor, and poor rich?</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>Outward proſperity is ſometimes given in wrath. He gave them a King in his anger, and took him away in his wrath,</hi> Hoſ. 13. 11. God gave quailes to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> but his wrath came along with them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 30, 31. 'Tis true of all outward things. <hi>The proſperity of fooles ſhall deſtroy them,</hi> Prov. 1. 32. Proſperitie kills more then adverſitie. But now, that which is an evidence of ſalvation, is never given in wrath. I ſhall anſwer one queſtion, and then I ſhall ſhut up this Rule, <hi>viz.</hi>

That Caution, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 17. notes the diſtemper. A full purſe ordinarily makes a big heart.

Prodigality is contrary to covetouſneſſe, &amp;c. Now it's poſſible for a man to leave ſome ſinne out of love to another ſinne; to part with covetouſneſſe out of love to prodigality. A man may put out ſome of his children to make more room for the firſt-born, and yet he accounts them all his children. A mans heart may be ſo much addicted to one ſinne, that he may ſeeme to neglect all the reſt, to make the better proviſion for that which is moſt dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p n="1">(1) <hi>A man may be in a very good condition, and yet want peace of conſcience.</hi> A good conſcience, and an unquiet conſcience, ſometimes meet in one man. Though purity of conſcience be the way to peaceableneſſe of conſcience; yet the conſcience may be pure, and for the preſent unpeaceable. We have many inſtances of this in Scripture. That of <hi>Heman</hi> is very remarkable, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88. 15, 16. a very good man, as will appear by many inſtances in that <hi>Pſalme,</hi> yet had a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtormy conſcience. That inſtance in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 50. 10. is another proof of this. Yea, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf had alwayes a good conſcience, but he ſometimes wanted a peaceable conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; when he uttered thoſe words, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 46. he wanted ſerenity and peace. <hi>David</hi> a holy man, doth often complaine of unquietneſſe, and of great troubledneſſe in his conſcience. In the beginning of the new-birth, when the pangs are not well over; upon the hiding of Gods face, upon the ſtepping aſide into ſinne, upon want of evidence of grace, upon ſome great aſſault of Satan; in ſuch caſes conſciences that are very good, may be very unquiet.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>From the riſe of them.</hi> True peace proceeds from true ſpiritual roots, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Acquaintance with God,</hi> Job 22. 21. Falſe peace ariſeth rather from ignorance of God, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſſe of God; but true peace ariſeth from acquaintance and communion with him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>The knowledge of our juſtification.</hi> Of this the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1. When a perſon doth upon good grounds know that his perſon is put into a ſtate of juſtification, and thereupon

finds peace and quietneſſe in his ſpirit, this is a night born peace.</p>

                     <p n="2">II. <hi>From the manner of the working of his peace.</hi> True ſound peace hath uſually followed great conflicts of conſcience. True quietneſſe ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily grows out of diſquietneſſe. Storms uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally go before calmes.

                     <p n="3">III. <hi>From the properties of it.</hi> I ſhall name theſe three properties of true peace.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>It will allow no peace with ſinne.</hi> Carnal ſecurity is at amity with ſinne, at leaſt with ſome ſinne; but gracious peace is at enmity with all ſin. The Prophet mentions this fruit of it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85. 8.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, <hi>'Tis a great mercy that thou doeſt in any degree or meaſure exceed any of the ſonnes of men.</hi> As we are bound to bleſſe God that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do go beyond us, ſo 'tis our duty hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily to bleſſe God, that he hath made us in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny degree better then the vileſt of men. And we have great reaſon ſo to do in foure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>

And therefore it is that he pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the Elect, and regenerate, as well as others, to be <hi>by nature the children of wrath,</hi> Eph. 2. 3. This being true, it appears to be a mercy, that we are in any thing better then the vileſt of men. Though we be not ſo good as many, yet 'tis ſome happineſſe that we be not as vile as any.</p>

The juſtice of God diſtributes puniſhment for ſinne as the wages of it, and therefore according to the quantity of ſinne ſhall be the meaſure of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. And the Scripture is expreſſe to this purpoſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 22, 24. <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon</hi> ſhall not undergo ſo much torment as <hi>Chorazin</hi> and <hi>Bethſaida, Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> ſhall be inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in puniſhment to <hi>Capernaum.

A perſon may be well verſed in the Hiſtory of the Scriptures, in the Syſtem of Divinity, and yet for all that be in a bad condition as to his eternal ſtate. This I ſhall make good by theſe four Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>From the Apoſtles ſuppoſition,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. 1, 2. The Apoſtle ſuppoſeth a great meaſure of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Very few men attain to that height of knowledge which is there ſuppoſed. See the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions. <hi>To ſpeak with the tongue of men and Angels.</hi> To have the gift of prophecy, which God beſtowed upon many in the Primitive times, to underſtaad all myſteries and all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; yet its poſſible that all this may be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out one ſpark of true grace. Though a man could ſay all the Bible <hi>memoriter,</hi> could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve all the difficult caſes in Divinity; yet its poſſible that ſuch a man may be deſtitute of all ſaving grace.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>From experience.</hi> There are at preſent, there have been in former ages, many knowing and learned men, who had not the leaſt meaſure of true holineſſe. <hi>Judas</hi> was (without doubt) a man of great knowledge.

He could (for ought we find to the contrary) preach as well as any of the Apoſtles, and yet a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wicked man.

One effectual meanes to do this, is to endeavour to ſet ſinne upon the conſcience. To diſcover mens ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual eſtate unto their conſciences, that ſo they may be delivered from thoſe groſſe miſtakes about their condition under which they are held. 'Tis a very hard thing to perſwade men that they are ſick.

Conviction of ſinne is the firſt work of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16. 8. He is a convincing Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit before he be a comforting Spirit. You muſt give the Miniſters of Chriſt leave to ſet ſinne upon the conſcience. The fallow ground muſt be broken up before the ſeed of comfort be caſt in. A ſin-convincing Miniſtery is moſt likely to

Chriſt is tendred, life is held out in the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel from day to day. Wiſdom cryeth without, and lifts up her voice in the concourſe of the City, and yet men do not come in. Miniſters may complaine as the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> 49. 4. What is the reaſon? 'Tis becauſe men runne away with an opinion that they are well, that their condition is good, and therefore are the precious tenders of ſalvation ſo generally ſleighted.</p>

By this meanes the Apoſtle came to ſee his ſinne, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 7, 9. He thought inward concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence to be no ſinne, till God by his Law had better informed his judgement. He thought his condition while he was a Phariſee, to be as good as the condition of the beſt: but when God had tutor'd him a while by the Law, then he looked upon himſelfe as a dead man; when the

               <p>2. <hi>It doth convince the conſcience of the ſinner, that he is the guilty perſon whom the Law threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth with all that miſery.</hi> The Law of God doth point him out, as <hi>Nathan</hi> did <hi>David,</hi> and tells him that he is the man againſt whom all that wrath is denounced. The Apoſtle mentions this work of the Law, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 24, 25. The ſinner being ſmitten with the edge of the Law, falls down on his face, confeſſing that he is the very man that is guilty of ſuch ſinne, and liable to the miſeries due to ſuch ſin. The condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion diſcovered is his condition.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Law awakens the ſinner out of his ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, lets him ſee the impoſſiblity of his perſonal ſatisfying the Law, and ſo works horrour and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoniſhment in the ſoule.</hi> This effect it had on the Jaylor, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 29. his heart was ſet on a trembling frame, upon the apprehenſion of that ſad guilt and miſery under which he lay, from which he was not able to deliver him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. This is that which the Apoſtle calls, <hi>the Spirit of bondage,</hi> Romans 8. 15. which is oppoſed to <hi>the Spirit of Adoption.</hi> This is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thing.</p>
               <p>3. Why Chriſt takes this courſe in the heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſin? why will he not heal the ſinner, till he have him ſenſible that he is not in a ſound condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That ſinne may be imbittered.</hi> Sinne is in it ſelfe and evil and bitter thing. 'Tis compared unto gall and wormwood, and 'tis far more bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then either of theſe. Now 'tis the minde of God, that the ſinner ſhould taſte the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſinne before he be healed, <hi>Jer.</hi>

Now if the ſinner ſhould be healed before his ſinne be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, this deſigne of God would be fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That the ſinner may be willing to come up to his termes.</hi> When Chriſt begins at firſt to deale with a ſoule about the work of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he keeps a huge bogling, he doth exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly dodge with Jeſus Chriſt to bring him to low termes. Chriſt therefore ſhewes him his naked condition, what he is, and what he muſt expect if he cloſe not with him, and by this meanes he is brought to a ready and willing complyance with him. We ſee it in thoſe three thouſand which <hi>Peter</hi> converted, when their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition was diſcovered, when anguiſh and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour was upon their ſpirits, then they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to do any thing, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37. <hi>What ſhall we do to be ſaved?</hi> Thus alſo it was with <hi>Saul, Acts</hi> 9. 6. When Chriſt had created thoſe tremblings and aſtoniſhments in his ſpirit, then he comes off fully to Chriſt, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> So it was with the Jaylor: when he had a true repreſentation of his eſtate, then he cries out, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 30. <hi>Sirs, what muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi> A man that is in extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity will do any thing to ſave his life. When he ſees that he muſt periſh if he do not preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:38484:111"/>
conſent to what is propoſed, then he lingers not: if he muſt throw all his goods overboard, he is contented to caſt them out preſently, becauſe death is before him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>That the mercy of the cure may be more highly valued.</hi> Salvation from hell is a very great work which ſhould be valued by all on whom it is beſtowed. The Prophet <hi>David</hi> calls upon his ſoule, and all that is within his ſoule, to praiſe God for ſuch a mercy, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 103. <hi>init.</hi> He that conſiders the worth of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the unworthineſſe of the perſons enjoying it, the coſtlineſſe of it, the multitudes that ſhall never partake of it; muſt needs acknowledge it a thing worthy to be eſteemed. But ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful a piece is the heart of man, that he doth not value it at any conſiderable rate. Jeſus Chriſt therefore, before he bring any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch a ſtate, will diſcover their miſery to themſelves; that ſo he may provoke them to extraordinary thankfulneſſe for it. And the truth is, nothing doth ſo much enhance the price of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in our hearts, as a cleer manifeſtation of our wretched condition. See how the Apoſtles heart is enlarged upon this very conſideration, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15. Had he not ſeen himſelf to be the chief of ſinners, he would never have thought ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Chriſt worthy of all acceptation, as now he did.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>That the skill of the Phyſician may be more cleerly diſcovered.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt ſeeks to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance his own glory in all the works he does for the ſonnes of men; As in other his works, ſo eſpecially in this great work of converſion. Therefore it is, that he will not heale any till

                  </gap> may ſee his wiſdome, power, goodneſſe, in their healing. Men that think little or nothing ayles them, do not halfe ſo much value the Phyſicians paines, or skill, as thoſe that ſee themſelves at the very brink of the grave, when the Phyſician takes them in hand. Jeſus Chriſt therefore will ſhew them every ſort, that ſo they may publiſh his glory that wrought it for them. <hi>I was brought low, and he helped me,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſ. 116. 6. See how the poor blind man proclaims the honour of Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. 32.</p>
               <p>4. Whether Jeſus Chriſt obſerve the ſame method in this work of diſcovering the ſinners e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate to himſelfe? Whether all ſinners have the ſame meaſure of humbling and terror, and whether they continue for the ſame time under apprehenſions of wrath?</p>
               <p>Anſw. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is a free Agent. He is not tyed to any certaine method, nor doth he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes walk in the ſame way.</hi> His diſpenſations in the work of convincing men of ſinne, are various and different. The work is wrought on all ſo far as to make the ſoule ſenſible of ſinnes bitterneſſe above all other bitterneſſe, and to make it ſenſible of Chriſts excellency above all other excellent things. But that it is done in the ſame violent manner in all, or that it is of the ſame continuance, cannot be affirmed. Conviction and converſion may be wrought at the ſame Sermon, as we ſee it was with thoſe three thouſand, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37. 41. They were no ſooner pricked in their hearts, but they gladly received the word. There was great difference between this work in <hi>Lydia</hi> and in the Jaylor, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 14. God ſhewed her

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Some ſinners have been more ſcandalous then others.</hi> Theſe are brought to Chriſt with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er troubles, ſo it was with the Jaylor: he had been a cruel bloody man; God layes him under deep ſorrow.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>God hath a greater work to do by ſome ſinners then by others.</hi> Theſe he uſes to deal with in a more rough way, that he may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them for ſervice the better. This ſeems to be the reaſon of his ſo ſharp dealing with <hi>Saul, Act.</hi> 9. 15, 16.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Some ſinners are of a more rough turbulent nature then others.</hi> Theſe muſt be handled more ſeverely. Some men muſt be bound, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they will be ruled. So it is with ſome kinde of ſinners. Thus with <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> 2 Chr. 33. 11.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Some have been ſinners of a longer ſtanding then others.</hi> Theſe Chriſt uſeth to be more ſharp withal in his way of curing.</p>

               <head>The Uſes of this Point.</head>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>How ſad is the condition of thoſe that never yet were truly made ſenſible of their ſick eſtate.</hi> They never yet had a true, lively, ſenſible appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of their ſick condition. They were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much as pricked in their hearts for ſinne ſo as to make them loath it. They were never taken from all their high conceits of their own natural eſtate, &amp;c. Theſe men have cauſe to ſuſpect that ſinne is not yet cured. A perſon may have ſome conviction of his miſery and not be healed, but a man cannot be healed without ſome conviction. The heart cannot be broken for ſinne without the ſight of ſinne, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 31. There can be no ſelf-loathing, till there be a remembring of our wayes and doings that have not been good.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>How neceſſary the preaching of the Law is to true converſion.</hi> A man will never be taken off from the opinion of his own healthfulneſſe but by the preaching of the Law. The Law ſhews men what they are, what they may expect, &amp;c. The fallow ground of the heart will never be broken up without the plough of the Law, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. 3. The plough of the Law muſt go and make deep furrows too before the ſeed of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort be caſt in. Though the preaching of the Law do not convert, yet it helps forward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, in as much as it works that preparato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry work, without which converſion ordinarily
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:38484:113"/>
is not; as the needle makes way for the threed, ſo the Law makes way for converſion. The ſpirit of bondage makes way for the Spirit of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, and that is wrought by the preaching of the Law.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The miſtake of thoſe who are againſt all kinde of preparations to converſion.</hi> They would have mercy held out to ſinners as ſinners, not as ſinners ſo and ſo qualified. Surely the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture hath laid down qualifications for ſinners to whom the Goſpel is tendred. They muſt be humbled ſinners, burdened ſinners, &amp;c. The mercy of the Goſpel is not to be proſtituted to ſinners as ſinners, but to broken-hearted ſinners, to heart-wounded ſinners, to ſinners that ſee themſelves loſt in themſelves, to hungring and thirſting ſinners. The brazen Serpent was onely for ſuch to look upon as were ſtung with Serpents. Such as are in ſome meaſure ſenſible of the ſtinging nature of ſin, are to be invited to lay hold on Chriſt. As it is an undoing to wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſinners, to keep them from Chriſt, ſo 'tis an undoing to ſuch ſinners as are not in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure preſſed with ſinne to apply the promiſes of the Goſpel. This was prefigured in the Leper, <hi>The L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

'Tis no diſparagement to uſe his method, yea 'tis the greateſt wiſdome to preſcribe the ſame receits which Jeſus Chriſt preſcribes; he uſes to take men off from the opinion they have of their own way.

Though ſuch kinde of preaching put you to ſome preſent trouble, yet it will be to your eternal advantage. Your ſores cannot be healed comfortably till you ſee them to be ſores and feſtred ſores. You muſt be contented to ſuffer the ploughings of the Law, that you may be prepared for the comforts of the Goſpel.

               <p>Doct. 5. <hi>Thoſe that finde themſelves to be ſpiritually ſick, ſhall finde Jeſus Chriſt a Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ready to heale them.</hi> No Phyſician was ever ſo ready to heale a ſick brother, as Jeſus Chriſt will be to cure a ſin-ſick ſinner. We finde in the Goſpel that Chriſt was very willing to heal thoſe that came to him ſick of bodily infirmities. We do not, that I remember, read of any one that was ſent away uncured, that earneſtly begg'd his help either for themſelves, or any of theirs. The Leprous, the Paralytick, the Demoniack, the Lame, the Blinde, thoſe that

Chriſt ever valued the ſoule above the body, therefore he will be much more ready to heale the ſickneſſes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. He healed many of the ſick Publicans, when they ſaw their diſeaſes; As <hi>Zacheus, Matthew, &amp;c.</hi> And he will be to the end of the world, ready to afford the ſame mercy to any that are or ſhall be in their condition.</p>

Actual ſinnes are more obvious to the eye then origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſinne. This is a ſinne lying under ground, more remote, at a greater diſtance from the cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of a ſinner, therefore peradventure ſome actual offence firſt is ſet upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, but ſooner or later doth this actual ſin bring to the ſinners conſcience, the ſight of that ſinne, which is the root both of this and of all other actual ſinnes; namely, <hi>that body of death, that law of the members,</hi> as the Apoſtle calls it. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 23. <hi>Which continually warreth againſt the Law of the minde.</hi>

This is that which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour calls labouring, and being heavy loaden, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 28. Sickneſſe when 'tis ſeen, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore accompanied with paine and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Diſ-ſatisfaction with the preſent condition.</hi> This follows upon the former; And you will finde it hath ever been in ſuch as have ſeen their ſpiritual ſickneſſe. What is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe queſtions which were propounded by the three thouſand, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It was no pleaſing thing to them to continue any longer in that condition. As if they ſhould have ſaid, 'tis no abiding in this eſtate.

                  </gap> is with a conſcience-wounded ſinner, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be contented with that eſtate. Though he know not how to get out, yet he cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to abide there.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Deſpaire of deliverance by any thing in himſelfe.</hi> He that is ſick of ſinne, looks upon himſelfe as utterly unable to help himſelfe. This is that which is called in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place ſpiritual poverty. And, ſaith <hi>Calvin, Nemo ſpiritu pauper, niſi qui in nihilum apud ſe redactus.</hi> Thus it was with thoſe ſick ſinners before-named. Their asking ſo ſeriouſly what they muſt do, did clearly imply that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves knew not what to do? ſomething they thought muſt be done, and yet they knew not what it was. No man is truly ſick, but he that doth clearly ſee that in regard of himſelfe, he is both helpleſſe and hopeleſſe. Self-inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency is one ingredient of ſpiritual ſickneſſes. Self-denial and ſoule ſickneſſe are evermore companions. This is cleare from the Publicans confeſſion and prayer, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 13. He goes out of himſelfe to God, acknowledging that if ever he was healed, he muſt be healed by mercy.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>A willingneſſe to take any courſe God would have him, ſo he may be healed.</hi> This is implied in that queſtion ſo often mentioned, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37. <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 6. <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 30. They are very ready to follow the advice of God given by his Miniſters for a ſpeedy cure. Cut them, lance them, ſcar them, bleed them, purge them, any thing to free them from ſinne, any thing to ſave them from wrath, which is ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:38484:116"/>
them. They will ſtick at nothing, let God take his own way, and uſe his own medicines; whatever he preſcribes, they are reſolved to drink it down be it never ſo bitter, be it never ſo unſavory, be it never ſo contrary to their corrupt conſtitution. They hope he can heal them, they are willing he ſhould uſe his own method for the healing of them. This is the firſt thing, wherein ſpiritual ſickneſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That Chriſt is ready to heal ſuch ſinners as theſe. This appears three ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>He inviteth ſuch to come to him for cure.</hi> The invitations of Chriſt are not empty comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as the invitations of men often are, but real things. He is not in j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſt, but in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, when he bids men repaire to him. Never did one friend ſend to another with ſo much heartineſſe, as Chriſt doth to men. Now we ſhall finde him inviting ſinners under this qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification. That's a famous place in <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 28. <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour, and are heavy loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and I will give you r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y and verity. Now 'tis his promiſe to cure heart-wounded ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. That in <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 28. hath an expreſſe
<pb facs="tcp:38484:116"/>
promiſe annexed to the invitation. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of refreſhing or giving reſt, is as good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> if he had ſaid, <hi>I will heal you.</hi> To this agrees that in <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 3, 4, 6. Poverty of ſpirit, mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of ſpirit, hungring and thirſting do all go in into the deſcription of the ſickneſſe of the ſoule, and to each of theſe doth Chriſt make ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe and ful promiſes of ſpiritual healing. Chriſts Promiſe is the beſt ſecurity Heaven or earth can afford.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>God the Father hath promiſed it in Chriſts behalf.</hi> You will many times finde that the Prophets which have prophecied of him before his incarnation, have by Gods appointment, and in Gods Name engaged themſelves that he ſhould heal ſuch ſinners. That is a very full place amongſt others, <hi>Eſay</hi> 42. 3. that it's meant of Chriſt, is clear from <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 20. where this text is applied to Chriſt, and it's applied to him upon this account, that <hi>he healed the man with a withered hand,</hi> v. 10. 13. and multitudes of other diſeaſed perſons, <hi>v.</hi> 15. whereupon this of the Prophet is brought in, <hi>Behold my ſervant, &amp;c. A bruiſed reed ſhall he not break, &amp;c.</hi> The words are a <hi>Meioſis,</hi> more is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood then is expreſſed. <hi>He ſhall not bruiſe,</hi> the meaning is, he ſhall ſtrengthen it, <hi>he ſhall not quench,</hi> the meaning is, he ſhall cauſe it to flame, and nouriſh it. By <hi>the bruiſed reed, and the ſmoaking flax,</hi> we are to underſtand ſuch ſinners as are bruiſed, and bowed down under the ſenſe of their great wretchedneſſe; theſe ſinners Chriſt will be ready to cheriſh. You have it ſet out by another Metaphor, <hi>Chapter</hi> 40. 11. <hi>He ſhall carry the lambs, and gently lead them that are with young.</hi> Who are the lambs,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:38484:117"/>
and ſuch as with young, but broken-ſpirited Chriſtians that are overwhelmed and preſſed down with the apprehenſion of their own mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery? Chriſt will be ſo farre from neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe that he will put them in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, a place of warmth, tenderneſſe and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.</p>
               <p>3. Why Chriſt is ſo ready to heal ſuch ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>He doth it in obedience to his Commiſſion.</hi> God the Father, when he ſent him into the world, gave him a very ſpecial charge concerning theſe perſons. He was on purpoſe anointed to the place and office of a Phyſician, that he might take care of ſuch as theſe. You may read his Commiſſion ſet down at large, <hi>Eſay</hi> 61. 1, 2, 3. There you have the Patients de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, and the Phyſick applied, and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority enjoyning and enabling. The Patients are deſcribed by ſuch termes as ſet out the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibleneſſe of their condition. The meek, the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken-hearted, the captives, them that are bound, them that mourne in <hi>Zion,</hi> them that ſit in aſhes, them that are under the ſpirit of heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. The cure is ſet down in expreſſions ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the nature of theſe ſickneſſes. To the meek good tydings, to the broken hearted bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, to the captives liberty, to them that are bound, the opening of the priſon; to them that mourne, comfort, the oile of joy; to them that are in aſhes, beauty; to the ſpirit of heavineſſe, the garment of praiſe. The Authority enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, this is the Divine unction of the Father by the Spirit. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, the Lord hath anointed me.</hi> So <hi>Eſay</hi> 50. 4. Jeſus Chriſt is a very exact obſerver of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

Commandment. He hath his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               <p n="2">2. <hi>From the instigation of his own mercifulneſſe.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt is very tender-hearted, he is full of the bowels of compaſſion. The Apoſtle calls him <hi>a merciful and faithful High Prieſt,</hi> Heb. 2. 17. He could not be a compleat High Prieſt, if he wanted either of theſe. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo merciful and compaſſionate, he will not turne away his bowels from them that are in ſo dejected a condition. This is rendred as the reaſon why he was ſo ready to heale the wounded travellor, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 33, 34. <hi>When he ſaw him he had compaſſion on him, and bound up his wounds.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt hath loſt none of his tenderneſſe by going into heaven. He is ſtill touched with the ſenſible feeling of our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4 15. this inclines him to this readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That he may not loſe the glory of that work which he hath begun.</hi> The humbling and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing of proud ſinners, is as truly the work of Chriſt as the reſtoring of humbled ſinners. 'Tis his work to prick the heart as well as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the heart. Now if he ſhould humble and convince a ſinner, and then leave him, and proceed no farther, he would loſe the honour of what he hath done. The ſoule doth not heartily praiſe Chriſt for conviction, till con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction be carried on to converſion. The ſoul ſo long as it abides onely under the paines of
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:38484:118"/>
conviction apprehends no love, but onely wrath and anger, and ſo long as the love of Chriſt is unſeen, the glory of Chriſt is not proclaimed. Now Chriſt will not loſe the glory of the firſt work, therefore is he ſo careful and ready to carry on the ſecond work.</p>

This Doctrine is a good preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative againſt ſuch temptations; you that ſee ſinne and complaine of your ſpiritual ſickneſſes, know this to your comfort that as Chriſt hath prepared you for healing, ſo he will be ready to heale you.</p>

But we muſt know that a perſon may be healed, both of the guilt of ſinne by Juſtification, and of the dominion of ſinne by Sanctification, and yet ſtill finde many ſores of ſinne upon, and new ſores breaking out every day in him. <hi>Paul</hi> was healed, when he cried out, <hi>O miſerable man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death?</hi> Romans 7. 24. <hi>David</hi> was healed, and yet he cries out, <hi>My wounds ſtink and are corrupt through my fooliſhneſſe,</hi> Pſalme 38. 5. and againe, <hi>verſe</hi> 7. <hi>My loynes are filled with a loathſome diſeaſe, and there is no ſoundneſſe in my fleſh.</hi> When the love of ſinne, the ſecret delight in ſinne, the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ſinne, the commanding rule of ſinne are removed, though there continue many wounds and ſcarres too upon the ſoule, the cure of ſinne is wrought, and that which is wanting ſhall perfectly be finiſhed.</p>

Is it any wonder if ſuch ſay, they are not healed? 'Tis becauſe they will not be healed. They are not worthy of mercy, and therefore they will have none.

            <p>Doct. <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt is the ſpiritual light of the world.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt in three reſpects is the natural light of the world as he is God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>He created the light.</hi> The firſt light that ever ſhined in the world was his creature. The Sunne, Moon and Starres, which are the veſſels of natural light, are the works of his hands. He as well as the Father is that Jehovah, who at firſt ſaid, <hi>Let there be light, and there was light,</hi> Gen. 1. 3. <hi>For all things were made by him, and without him was not made any thing that was made,</hi> John 1. 3. All the luminaries of heaven, which carry the light of nature abroad, are his creatures.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>He preſerves the light.</hi> The ſinne of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde would extinguiſh thoſe veſſels of light<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thoſe lamps of the world, did not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt by his Divine power and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence keep them burning. When the Sunne is ſet, and darkneſſe ſpread upon the world, it would never riſe again if Chriſt did not give it a Command.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>He it is that created the eye of man, and endued it with power to ſet the light.</hi> It is he that (as God) formed the eye of man, and gave it power to behold the light of the Sunne. It is he alſo that by his providence opens the eye, when it is by ſleep ſhut up in darkneſſe.
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:38484:123"/>
Theſe windows of the body would be pitched up for ever, if Chriſt did not open them morning by morning. <hi>Davids</hi> prayer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 13. 3. muſt be our daily prayer, <hi>Lighten mine eyes, lest I ſleep the ſleep of death.</hi> In all theſe reſpects, Chriſt according as he is God, is the natural light of the world. And as Mediator he is the ſpiritual light of the world. He was ſo when he was on earth and that both by his Doctrine, and by his example. And he is ſtill the ſpiritual light of men. The Scripture doth often affirme this of Chriſt. See a few places, <hi>John</hi> 1. 9. that was (ſpeaking of Chriſt) the true light which lighteth every man that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into the world, <hi>John</hi> 12. 35, 36, 46. What can be more expreſſe? The Prophets who Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecyed of him, ſpake of him as a light, <hi>Eſay</hi> 42. 6. <hi>I give thee for a Covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles.</hi> And <hi>Eſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 49. 6. <hi>I will give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayeſt be my ſalvation to the end of the earth.</hi> He is therefore compared to the <hi>day-ſtar,</hi> Luke 1. 78. To the <hi>Sunne,</hi> Mal. 4. 2. As all natural light is collected into the veſſel of the Sunne, and by it diſpenſed to the world, ſo all ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al light is gathered together, and placed in Chriſt the Sunne of righteouſneſſe, and by him communicated unto all thoſe whom God hath given him.</p>

                  </gap>

            </list>
            <p>Firſt, the reſemblance between Chriſt and light ſtands in ſeven things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Light hath a manifeſtative quality.</hi> It doth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover and cauſe to appear things that do in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs lie unſeen. Darkneſs is a thick veile and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow under which things and perſons are conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but light removes that ſhadow, and ſhews both it ſelf and every other thing in its own nature. When you would ſee what a thing is, if you do not know it, you bring it forth to the light, and then it appears. Whatſoever doth make manifeſt, the ſame is light, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 13. Jeſus Chriſt in this reſpect is well compared to light. He diſcovers and makes manifeſt to men that which they never ſaw before. How many rare myſteries hath Chriſt diſcovered to the ſonnes of men? When he came into the world, he revealed thoſe ſecrets that before were either not known, or not ſo fully known. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaks of this, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 2. 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9. When Chriſt comes to a ſoul, what diſcoveries doth he make there?</p>
            <p n="1">(1) That ſin which lay hid for many years is now manifeſt; that pride, that unbelief, that covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which was not diſcovered before, is now made manifeſt. The very ſecrets of the heart are made known when this light begin; to ſhine, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 14. 25. The ſoule wonders, that ſo much wickedneſſe ſhould be ſo long undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) That ſhining beauty which is in grace, which was not before diſcerned, is now made manifeſt. He ſees godlineſſe to be another
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:38484:124"/>
kinde of thing then he ever apprehended it to be. He ſees a lovelineſſe in every duty of Gods worſhip, a lovelineſſe in every act of holineſſe which he could have not believed, ſo that he is able to ſay with the blinde man reſtored by Chriſt; <hi>This I know, that whereas I was blinde, now I ſee.</hi> Chriſt hath the diſcovering quality of light.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Light hath a Directive vertue.</hi> It guids men in their way. The Traveller by the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the light, ſees what path to keep which way to turne to his intended journey. Our Saviour mentions this effect of light, <hi>John</hi> 11. 9, 10. Now Chriſt is fitly called a light in this regard. He it is that doth direct the ſonnes of men in the way to life. And therefore he is called, not onely the light by which we ſee, but the guide that leads us, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 79. Yea, he is called not onely the light and the guide, but the way in which we walk, <hi>John</hi> 14. 6. Jeſus Chriſt is ſent by his Father from heaven, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect his Elect to heaven. He is the great Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot of his Church, that doth ſteer it through the tempeſtuous ſeas of this world to the Haven of glory.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Light hath a Penetrating vertue.</hi> Light is of all creatures that are material, the moſt imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial; it is of ſo ſubtile a nature, that it conveys it ſelfe into the leaſt creviſe. You can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make any fence ſo cloſe, as wholly to keep out the light. Jeſus Chriſt hath a penetrating and ſearching power. No heart ſo cloſe, but his eye is in it; no conſcience ſo dark, but he ſees to the bottome of it. See what the Apoſtle ſaith of him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 13. <hi>All things are naked and open to his eyes, and every creature is manifeſt in his ſight.</hi>

               </gap>me of that heat which the heavenly bodies ſend down upon the earth. Light is that inſtrument where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all the influences of heaven are communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and diſpenſed to the world. The motions of nature are both quickned and comforted by the light, and by it all the births of nature are cheared and comforted. Jeſus Chriſt, hath a chearing, comforting and quickning vertue. 'Tis by influences from Chriſt ſpiritual life and comfort are obtained and preſerved. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaks of this vertue of Chriſt, under this very Metaphor of light, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4. 2. All that ſpiritual livelineſſe, and briskneſſe that beleevers have at any time in their hearts, is from the beaming wings of Chriſt the Sonne of righteouſneſſe. He is a heart-chearing, a heart-warming, a heart-quickening Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Light hath a Purifying vertue.</hi> Fogs and Miſts that are gathered in darkneſſe, are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed and ſcattered when the light comes. When a candle is lighted and ſet up in a room, if there be any damps, they gather about it. Light is the fining pot of Nature. The world would be an unwholſom Peſt-houſe if it had not light. Jeſus Chriſt hath a purifying and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vertue. By vertue from him it is, that thoſe naſty filthineſſes of ſinne which are in the ſoul, are purged away, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 14. All the Levitical, Ceremonial purifications uſed in the Law, were types of him. The Prophet compares him to a refiner, and purifier of ſilver, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 3. By his
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:38484:125"/>
blood he purifies the ſoul from the guilt of ſin. By his grace he cleanſeth the ſoul from the filth of ſinne. The Prophet compares him to a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſet open for purification, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13. 1. All that ever were, all that ever ſhall be clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from the filthineſſe of ſin, are cleanſed by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Light is of an undefilable nature.</hi> Though it paſſe through ſinks, and the moſt polluted places, yet it contracts no defilement. It clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth all things, but is defiled by nothing. It is a quality ſo ſpiritual, that nothing can faſten upon it to pollute it. Jeſus Chriſt is fitly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled to light in this reſpect. He is not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of any defilement. He aſſumed ſinful nature without the leaſt ſinne. He had the likeneſſe of ſinful fleſh, <hi>Rom</hi> 8. 3. but not the leaſt ſinne in his fleſh. In the dayes of his fleſh he did as a ſpiritual Phyſician, repaire to all ſorts of ſinners, but he carried away from them no pollution at all. He converſed with <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> with <hi>Zacheus</hi> the Publican, and other Publicans and ſinners without the leaſt taint of corruption. He was born, he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and died in a corrupt generation, in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Peſt-houſe of ſinne, without the leaſt tincture of ſinne. He lived and died holy, harmleſſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled, and ſeparated from ſinners, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 26.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>The nature of the light is hard to be known.</hi> The Philoſophers are much troubled about the defining and deſcribing of it. 'Tis not a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial forme, becauſe it is perceived by the ſight, which no ſubſtantial forme is. 'Tis not a body, becauſe then when the light paſſeth through a perſpicuous body, two bodies would

be in one place, which is againſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e quality, and ſo very hard to be deſcribed. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeaks of the difficulty of ſearching out the nature of the light perfectly by any mortal man, <hi>Job</hi> 38. 19, 20, 21, 24. Onely he who is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of lights doth perfectly underſtand it. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is not perfectly to be underſtood by any living man. <hi>Who can declare his generation, as he is the Sonne of God?</hi> Eſay 53. 8. <hi>Who can declare his conception exactly, as he is the Sonne of man?</hi> the Holy Ghoſt hath overſhadowed it, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 35. He that created the fleſh of Chriſt, is onely able perfectly to underſtand the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it. Who is able to declare the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the hypoſtatical union of the two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in one perſon exactly? We beleeve theſe things, comprehend them perfectly we are not able. His Name is wonderful, <hi>Eſay</hi> 9. 6. there are ſuch wonderful myſteries in the nature of this light, as no man, no creature can fully and perfectly comprehend.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Chriſt diſpenſes this light theſe two wayes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>By the preaching of his Goſpel in the publick Miniſtery thereof.</hi> The Miniſters are called Stars; and the Miniſtery or preaching of the Goſpel, is that Orb in which this light ſhines, and by which it is communicated and diſpenſed to the world. <hi>We preach Christ crucified,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 23. Where the Goſpel hath never been preached, this light hath never yet ſhined. This is the chariot in which this glorious light is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:38484:126"/>
about ordinarily in the world, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 3, 4, 5, 6.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>By the vertuous efficacy of his Spirit in the Ministery.</hi> The moſt powerful preaching of Chriſt that can be, will be to no purpoſe without theſe inward workings of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. By the Spirit of Chriſt three things are done.</p>
            <p n="1">(1) <hi>The blindneſſe of the minde is removed.</hi> The holy Ghoſt cauſes the skales to fall off the eyes.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) <hi>A viſive faculty is beſtowed.</hi> This is that which the Apoſtle calls the enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the eyes of the underſtanding, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 18.</p>
            <p n="3">(3) <hi>Power is given actually to cloſe with the light.</hi> The ſoule is enabled to follow the light, or to walk in the light as our Saviours phraſe is, <hi>John</hi> 12. 35. So that by theſe two meanes this light is communicated. By the preaching of the Goſpel, the object is made preſent; and by the Spirit of Chriſt the object is made viſible, the faculty of ſight is beſtowed, and a power of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the light is created.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Chriſt is differenced from all other lights, <hi>viz.</hi> Prophets, Apoſtles who are called lights, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 14. He is differenced from all them five ways.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>They are lights onely Miniſterially.</hi> They are lights onely as they do by their office hold out this light. They are lights, as the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſtick may be called a light, becauſe it carries the candle where the light is. But Chriſt is a light of and in himſelfe; He is a light, not Miniſterially, but Originally. The fountaine of light.</p>

               </gap>, Chriſt is as a great Torch which teacheth from heaven to earth. They are light as the Stars are light, a little glimmering, borrowed light. Chriſt is light as the Sunne, and therefore he is called, <hi>The Sonne of righteouſneſſe,</hi> Mal. 4. 2. All the Prophets and Apoſtles were but <hi>Scintil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lulae lucis,</hi> little ſparks of light, meer glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms, but Jeſus Chriſt is an immenſe incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible light, <hi>Eſay</hi> 9. 2.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>They are lights that have ſome darkneſſe in them.</hi> The cleareſt and brighteſt of the Prophets and Apoſtles were not without ſome darkneſſe and obſcurity. But <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is light, and in him there is no darkneſſe at all.</hi> Chriſt is a light that hath no ſnuff in him. He ever burns and ſhines brightly.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>They were lights that could not give ſight.</hi> They were not able to make men either ſee their light, or follow their light. They could not give eyes to the blinde; but Jeſus Chriſt is ſuch a light as can give ſight. He can open the blinde eyes. He can over-power the ſoul to follow the light.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>They were ſetting lights.</hi> They when they had runne their courſe left ſhining, they were waſting, decaying lights. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> was a burning and ſhining light, but now he is neither, as to this world, onely his example and Doctrine ſhines ſtill in the Scripture. But Jeſus Chriſt is an everlaſting light. He hath been ſhining ever ſince that promiſe made to <hi>Adam,</hi> Gen. 3. 15. and he ſhall be a light for ever and ever. He is the light of grace here, and he ſhall be the light of glory in heaven.</p>

The Uſes are, Information. Exhortation. Conſolation.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Information.</hi> In foure particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Behold the neceſſity of Chriſt.</hi> He is as neceſſary for the ſoul, as light is for the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Light is a very needful and pleaſant thing. Jeſus Chriſt is as neceſſary as he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>The miſerable condition of ſuch as want an intereſt in Chriſt.</hi> Whether they be Nations or Perſons, their condition is marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſad. They are indeed in a ſtate of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. The Scripture affirmes all to be in darkneſſe that are without Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>Ye were ſometimes darkneſſe, &amp;c.</hi> Luke 1. 79. <hi>Eſay</hi> 9. 2. The people that ſate in darkneſſe have ſeen a great light. Where this day-ſtar did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet ſhine, 'tis yet mid-night with that ſoul. A dark condition is a very miſerable condition. The miſery of it will appear in three particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
            <p n="1">(1) <hi>A dark condition is a condition of feare.</hi> Thoſe that can be bold in the light, are uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurprized with feares in darkneſſe. A black day is a terrible day, <hi>Job</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Let the blackneſs of the day terrifie it.</hi> Thoſe that are without Jeſus Chriſt are ſubject to many terrours and fears, which the children of light are delivered from.

            <p n="3">(3) <hi>The excellency of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Light is a very excellent and glorious creature. Truly light is pleaſant, ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> and a joyful thing it is for the eyes to ſee the Sun, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 11. 7. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is an excellent and precious perſon. He is very pleaſant and deſirable to thoſe that have eyes to behold him. He is all things ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually to the ſoule which it wants, which it can deſire; bread, drink, phyſick, life, rayment, light, all in all. The Scripture ſpeaks much of his glory and brightneſſe. No creature com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to the light for glory. God is therefore ſaid to be cloathed with light as with a garment, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 104. 2. Chriſt is unglorious to the eyes of blinde men, ſo the Prophets foretold, <hi>Eſay</hi> 53. 2, 3. But to them that have eyes to ſee him, he is a very glorious perſon. Jeſus Chriſt hath a foure-fold excellency above other lights.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>They are created lights.</hi> The Sun, Moon and Stars, the veſſels of light are but creatures, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. You reade of the time and manner of their creation. But Chriſt is an uncreated light. The humanity indeed is a creature, but the Divinity which doth enlighten the humanity is not a creature. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> calls him light of lights, very God of very God. He is the Father of Lights in regard of his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.</p>

               </gap>. Bring men that are blinde to the Sunne, let it ſhine with his greateſt ſplendor upon them, and they will not be recovered. The light of the Sun hath dazeld, and helpt to put out ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſeeing eyes, it never reſtored to ſight one blinde eye. But Jeſus Chriſt is a light that gives ſight to the blinde. He is an enlightning <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ight, he doth by his ſhining upon the ſoule, create in the ſoule a faculty of ſeeing, which it never had before, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6. When this light ſhines in the heart, the light of the knowledge of God is created. Hence the Apoſtle calls Chriſt <hi>a light that enlightneth every man that cometh into the world,</hi> Joh. 1. 9.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>They are lights onely to the body.</hi> The ſoul is not better for the light of the Sun. But Chriſt is a ſpiritual light<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he is a light to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, to the will, to the affections, to the whole inward man.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>They give light but in one place at once.</hi> The Sunne ſhines but in one Hemiſphaere at once. 'Tis night with us, when 'tis day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with our Antipodes; and when the Sunne ſhines there, it is darkneſſe with us. But now Jeſus Chriſt ſhines as a light in all places of the world, at one and the ſame time. He can caſt his beams when he pleaſeth all the world over. Chriſt ſhines in <hi>England</hi> and in <hi>America,</hi> at one and the ſame moment. And he hath told us of a time when he will give light to all the world.

               <p>Firſt, Concerning the ſhepherds. Here are five duties.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>This may teach them to act for Chriſt.</hi> It becomes all the Miniſters whom Chriſt hath made ſhepherds, to conſider that Chriſt is the great Shepherd.

This is the character of a true ſhepherd, in all his actings to ſerve the great Shepherd who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

See that famous Text, <hi>John</hi> 3. 26, 27, 28, 29, 30. He humbles himſelf to the duſt, that by his fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Chriſt might riſe.</p>

               <p n="3">3. <hi>This may encourage them in hoping for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from Chriſt.</hi> The great Shepherd doth take an account of the diligence and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of inferior ſhepherds: and if they be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in their work; whatever their ſucceſſe be, the great Shepherd will abundantly reward them. He that hath called himſelf the great Shepherd, knows what belongs to the work of a ſhepherd, and therefore he will conſider him according to his work. This the Apoſtle tells the ſhepherds, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>This ſhould teach them to go to this great ſhepherd, both for Paſtoral Abilities and for ſucceſſe.</hi> As they ſhould learn to carry themſelves in the managing of their Paſtoral work by Chriſts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample the great Shepherd, to be diligent, pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, watchful, affectionate as he was; ſo they ſhould, when they want ſtrength, wiſdome, encouragement, go to him. The great Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd who hath ſet them on work, will both ſtrengthen them in the work, and bleſſe them with ſucceſſe, though not ſo much as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, yet with ſo much as ſhall make them cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully go on with their work.</p>

They follow him without diſputing, they follow him without murmuring, they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him univerſally. It doth not become a ſheep of Chriſt to refuſe the Shepherds conduct. The Shepherd is wiſer then the ſheep; they will erre if they follow their own counſel, they cannot wander if they follow Chriſt. The ſheep are ſafe while they follow Chriſt, he never led any of his ſheep into dangerous places. When you heare the voice of the great Shepherd, be ſure to yield obedience. We are to obey the voice of ſubordinate ſhepherds, yet no farther then they teach Chriſts commands; but the voice of the great Sheperd is to be obeyed in all things. Let me adde but this one word to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade you to it; Jeſus Chriſt will not be a feeding Shepherd, where he may not be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be a ruling Shepherd; the diſcipline of Chriſt is an act of mercy to the ſheep, as well as his feeding.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Create no other ſhepherds then what Chriſt ſets over you.</hi> Chriſt is therefore called the great Shepherd, becauſe he appoints other ſhepherds under him to feed the flock. 'Tis the duty of Chriſts ſheep to adhere to theſe ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, and to reject all others though they come in Chriſts Name.

            </list>
            <p n="1">1. For the firſt. <hi>Chriſt is compared to a Vine in reſpect of both natures.</hi> Although ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblances do relate more chiefly to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, and ſome more chiefly to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane; yet the general is to be underſtood in reſpect of both natures. Chriſt is a Vine in reſpect of the whole perſon, as he is Mediatour, God and Man. It will be made evident by this Argument. Chriſt is a Vine in that reſpect and latitude, in which Beleevers are Branches ingraffed into him. Now the union between Chriſt and beleevers is not between them and the humanity of Chriſt onely, nor between them and the Divinity onely, but between them and the whole perſon<hi>:</hi> Not onely is the ſoule of a beleever united to the ſoul of Chriſt, nor the fleſh of a beleever to the fleſh of Chriſt; but the whole perſon of every beleever is united to the whole perſon of Chriſt. This is the firſt particular.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In what reſpects in Chriſt a Vine? In four reſpects.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In regard of the meanneſſe of his outward condition.</hi> The Vine is not like the Cedar for height, nor is it comparable to the Oak for ſtrength, 'tis but meane to the outward view. Jeſus Chriſt when he came into the world, did not come with any great outward pomp and glory. There was indeed a ſtar at his birth,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:38484:152"/>
that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ught the wiſe men from the Eaſt to worſhip him, but for his outward condition generally it was very meane: he was born in a ſtable, laid in the manger; he was born of a mean Virgin, and his life was but mean here on earth. His Kingdome is not adminiſtred with that outward ſtate and ſplendor that earthly Kingdomes are. Jeſus Chriſt did decline all outward glory and greatneſſe. See what the Prophe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t of a dry ground, &amp;c.</hi> The reaſon of this is that which he himſelfe gives to <hi>Pilate,</hi> John 18. 36. <hi>His Kingdome was not of this world. He came not to be Miniſtred unto, but to Miniſter,</hi> Mat. 20. 28 He came to make others great, but to make himſelf little; to fill others, but to empty himſelf, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 7. He came in the forme of a ſervant to be trampled upon, to be reviled, diſgraced, and at laſt cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.

               </gap> wayes of being Branches of Chriſt. The one is by external profeſſion onely. In this reſpect, all that are members of the viſible Church are Branches of Chriſt. Thus the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, that all the Gentiles when they were called into the Church by the preaching of the Goſpel, were graffed into Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 17. the Metaphor is often uſed in that Chapter. This is not that ingraffing which I ſhall now handle. For though it be an honour and priviledge to be a branch of Chriſt in this general way, yet is it not a ſaving priviledge. A man may be a Branch of Chriſt in this reſpect, and yet at laſt be cut off and burned. So our Saviour ſaith in the verſe after the Text. The other way of being graffed or made a Branch of Chriſt, is by the grace of union. Thus all true Beleevers, and onely true Beleevers are made Branches. This is that which the Apoſtle elſewhere calls being members of Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 30. and dwelling in Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 6. 56. and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 27. That they are made Branches of Chriſt, beſides theſe teſtimonies of Scripture, it will appeare from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, both of Baptiſme and the Supper. This is the plaine language of both the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Baptiſme ſpeaks it.</hi> 'Tis the ſeal and ſigne of this ingraffing. This is clear from two texts before cited; the one, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 5. <hi>If we have been planted together into the likeneſſe of his death,</hi> How is that? ſee verſe before. <hi>We are buried</hi>

               </gap>, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 27. <hi>As many of you as have been Baptized into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt.</hi> Nor as if all bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized perſons were really made Branches, but becauſe this is ſealed in Baptiſme as the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all Beleevers. They are as certainly made Branches of Chriſt inviſibly and myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, as all that are baptized are made members of the Church viſibly and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Supper of the Lord doth alſo ſpeak it.</hi> Our eating and drinking of Chriſt Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally is a ſeat and pledge of our being ingraffed into him ſpiritually. This is cleare from that Text I cited before, <hi>John</hi> 6. 56. <hi>He that eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.</hi> We are therefore nouriſhed by his fleſh and blood, becauſe we are united to his body.

            <p>For the firſt, How men are made Branches of Chriſt. There are three things which concur to this work of the ſouls ingraffing into Chriſt. The Word of God, The Spirit of God, Juſtifying Faith.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Word of God.</hi> The Word preached is the ordinary and common mediate inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereby this great work is wrought. By this Word is the ſoule firſt cut off from the wilde ſtock of corrupt nature, and planted into the true Olive-tree, or Vine, Jeſus Chriſt. Hence the work of planting is in Scripture attributed
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:38484:162"/>
to the Miniſters of the Goſpel, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6, 7. <hi>I have planted,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Apollo watered.</hi> God indeed is the great Planter. So <hi>v.</hi> 1. of this Chapter. <hi>I am the true Vine, and my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</hi> He is the Maſter-Planter, the Miniſters are ſubordinate-planters; <hi>We are labourers together with God.</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 9. They are ſo called, becauſe by the Word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, this great work is done, This the Prophet clearly affirmes, <hi>Eſay</hi> 61. 1, 2, 3. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, becauſe the Lord hath anointed me to preach Chriſt; that they might be called trees of righteouſneſſe, the planting of the Lord.</hi> Theſe myſtical trees are Gods planting; but the inſtrument wherby they are made ſuch trees, is the Word preached. Hence the Word is called the incorruptible ſeed of regeneration, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 23. As all the Trees and Plants in the firſt Creation were ſet, and ſprung up by the Word of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 11, 12. So are all theſe myſtical Branches ingraffed by the Miniſterial Word.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Spirit of God.</hi> The Holy Ghoſt is the immediate Inſtrument whereby the ſoule is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed. It is the Spirit which gives efficacy to the Word, both to cut off the ſoule from the ſtock of nature, and to implant it into the Stock of grace. The Word would never be able to tear off any perſon from his firſt root, if it were not edged and ſtreng<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hred by the Spirit of God. The Scripture calle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed as for other reaſons, ſo for this, becauſe he is the immediate inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereby God works in the hearts of his creatures. Particularly for this work of ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing
<pb facs="tcp:38484:162"/>
the ſoule into Chriſt, the Holy Ghoſt is affirmed to be the immediate inſtrument 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 13. <hi>By one Spirit are we all baptized into one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, &amp;c. and have been all made to drink into one ſpirit.</hi> And againe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 21, 22. where the Apoſtle ſpeaking of this great myſtery under another reſemblance, ſaith, that <hi>in Chriſt we are builded an habitation of God thorough the Spirit.</hi> The ſame Spirit which builds us upon Chriſt into one Temple, doth ingraffe us into Chriſt as one Vine.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Faith.</hi> This is the immediate inſtrumental cauſe on mans part. Faith is an uniting grace, it knits the ſoule to Chriſt, and Chriſt to the ſoul. Faith is an incorporating grace, it doth as it were embody the ſoule into Chriſt, making it one with Chriſt, and Chriſt with it. This is that which the Apoſtle ſaith. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4, 5. <hi>To whom coming as to a living ſtone, &amp;c. Ye al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo are built up as lively ſtones, &amp;c.</hi> Two things are obſervable in that Text.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that the Saints are built together upon Chriſt the foundation-ſtone, an holy houſe to God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, how Chriſt and they are cement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together into one building; this is by belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, ſet out by the expreſſion of coming, which is uſed ordinarily for beleeving, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 28. The Spirit of God firſt works ſaith in the heart of a perſon through the Word, and then the ſoul is by the Spirit through faith ingraffed into Chriſt, and made a lively Branch.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond particular, What advantage the ſoul hath by being a Branch of Chriſt, I ſhall here follow the Metaphor. The ſame advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage the Branch hath by being ingraffed into
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:38484:163"/>
the Stock, hath a Beleever in a ſpiritual ſenſe by being ingraffed into Chriſt. I name theſe five.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Spiritual ſupportation.</hi> The Branch hath this benefit from the Stock into which it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed, that it is born up and ſupported by it. The Branch doth not bear the Vine, nor doth it beare it ſelf, but is born of the Vine. A beleever hath ſupportation from Jeſus Chriſt. We ſtand on Chriſts legs, not on our own. <hi>I can do all things</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>through Christ that strengthneth me,</hi> Phil. 4. 13. The ſtrength of the Branch is in the Vine; ſo is the ſtrength of a Beleever in Chriſt. <hi>Who is this that cometh out of the Wilderneſſe leaning on her beloved!</hi> Cant. 8. 5. <hi>I laid me down and ſlept,</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) I awaked, for the Lord ſuſteined me.</hi> Many blaſts paſſe over a beleever, many violent concuſſions and ſhakings is he expoſed unto, partly by reaſon of ſinne, partly by tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations from the Devil, from men; in all theſe ſhakings he hath ſuſtentation from Chriſt into whom he is implanted. <hi>My grace</hi> (ſaith Chriſt to <hi>Paul) ſhall be ſufficient for thee; for my strength is made perfect in weakneſſe,</hi> in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 9. A beleever may with confidence go to Chriſt, and pray for ſupport in all his weakneſſes. A be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever may go to Chriſt and chalenge ſupport. Chriſt would never have made thee a Branch, if he had not intended to ſupport and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then thee, <hi>Eſay</hi> 41. 10. there are repeated promiſes of ſuſtentation. <hi>I will ſtrengthen thee, I will help thee, I will uphold thee.</hi> In doing, in ſuffering, in dying is a beleever ſupported by Chriſt. A beleever never wants ſupport; but when either through pride he will not have it,
<pb facs="tcp:38484:163"/>
or through ſlothfulneſſe he will not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Spiritual nouriſhment.</hi> The Bran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> doth not give nouriſhment to the Stock, nor doth it nouriſh it ſelfe, but it receives nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment from the Stock. A beleever hath nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment from Jeſus Chriſt. The Root feeds the Branch, it conveys its ſap to each Branch, whether it be great or little, whether it be near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the Root, or at a farther diſtance from it. Chriſt conveys proper nouriſhment to every beleever. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of this, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 19. The whole body from Chriſt by joynts and bands hath nouriſhment miniſtred; the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances are the joynts and bands by which nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment is carried, but Chriſt is the great trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury from whence it is carried. He nouriſhes Faith, he feeds Hope, he nouriſheth love, &amp;c. <hi>Of his fulneſſe have we all received, and grace for grace,</hi> John 1. 16. Every grace a beleever hath, would die and wither, if it did not receive daily nouriſhment from Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Spiritual increaſe.</hi> The branch receives its Augmentation from the Vine. The graffe when it's firſt implanted, is very ſmall; a childe may break it with one of his fingers: but by abiding in the Stock it grows till it come to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. All a Beleevers increaſe is from Jeſus Chriſt. 'Tis by and through him that we grow from infancy to a perfect man. Two Texts of Scripture do fully ſet out this benefit of our implantation; The one is, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 19. <hi>In him the whole body having nouriſhment miniſtred, increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with the increaſe of God.</hi> The other is, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 16. Where the Apoſtle tells us, that by and from Chriſt the <hi>whole body being fitly joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:38484:164"/>
               <hi>and compacted by that which every part ſupplieth, maketh increaſe of the body.</hi> That their knowledge is ſtronger then it was at firſt, that the habits of grace are ſtrengthned, &amp;c. This is by vertue of their implantation into the Vine. Chriſt is the beleevers breaſt; the beleever by ſucking at the breſt, growes from a childe to a young man, from a young man to an old man in Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Spiritual fructification.</hi> The fruitfulneſſe of the Branch is from the fulneſſe of the Root. The Stock ſends out its ſap to every Branch, and ſo every branch buds, and bloſſoms, and brings forth fruit Abeleevers ſpiritual fruitfulneſs is from Jeſus Chriſt. Chriſt ſends out his ſap and fatneſſe to him, and then he doth according to his kind, bud, and bloſſome, and bring forth fruits in his ſeaſon. This is that which followes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after the Text; <hi>He that abideth in me, and I in him, the ſame bringeth forth much fruit, for without me ye can do nothing.</hi> 'Tis <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſeparated from me ye can do nothing. <hi>David,</hi> Pſalme 1. 3. tells us from whence our fruits ſpring, namely from our implantation. <hi>He ſhall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, which bringeth forth his fruit in his ſeaſon.</hi> So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92. 13. 14. <hi>Thoſe that be planted in the houſe of the Lord, ſhall flouriſh in the Courts of our God. They ſhall ſtill bring forth fruit in old age, &amp;c.</hi> This preheminencie theſe myſtical trees have of the natural. Old age makes the natural tree barren; but it makes the myſtical tree the more fruitful. Conſider what God ſaith to his people, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 8. <hi>From me is thy fruit found.</hi> This the Church acknowledgeth, when ſhe calleth them Chriſts fruits, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. 16.

            <p n="5">5. <hi>Spiritual fellowſhip.</hi> The Branch by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of its ingraffing into the Stock, hath fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the Stock, it doth partake of all the good of the Stock. A beleever by vertue of his implantation into Chriſt hath ſpiritual fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with Jeſus Chriſt in all his good things. <hi>God is faithful</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>by whom ye are called into the fellowſhip of his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 9.

               <p n="1">(1) <hi>That it is a Real union.</hi> The Branches and the Vine are not united appearingly, but truly. Chriſt and a beleever are united, not i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginarily, but really. Though it be an inviſible union to the eye of ſenſe, yet it is viſible to the eye of faith. Though it be a ſpiritual u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, yet it is a true union.

<pb n="314" facs="tcp:38484:166"/>
between the Vine and Branches, is not a looſe union, but a cloſe union; by vertue of this union they are made one tree.

They are not united together as a wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en legge is united to the body, onely by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal bands and ligaments; but as the natural legge is united to the body by inward bands, by thoſe influences of Spirits, Animal and Vital, which deſcend from the Head to the members. The beleever is not tied to Chriſt onely by the bands of an outward profeſſion, but made one with Chriſt by a reall incorporation. Chriſt and the beleever are made one, not by mixture, as water and wine are made one; but by mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, as the husband and wife are made one. Next to the union of the three perſons in one nature, and the union of the two natures of Chriſt in one perſon, this ſpiritual union between Chriſt and the beleever is the moſt glorious. This is the firſt inference.</p>

I beſeech you be fruitful. Let the fulneſſe of the root appear in the fruitfulneſſe of the Branches. And be ſure of this, that ye bring forth the fruits of the Stock.

            <p n="1">(1) Concerning Chriſt, there are two things uttered.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He bleſſed God for the Miſſion of Chriſt. <hi>v.</hi> 68. <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael, for he hath viſited his people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. He ſhews the benefit the Elect have by this ſending of Chriſt. This is two fold.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Redemption.</hi> This is amplified by many words which ſignifie one and the ſame thing. <hi>He hath redeemed his people, he hath raiſed up a horn of ſalvation, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Sanctification.</hi> This is ſet down <hi>v.</hi> 74, 75. <hi>That he would grant us, that being deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, &amp;c. We might ſerve him without fear in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe and righteouſneſſe, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Concerning <hi>John</hi> there are likewiſe two things Prophecied.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The nature of his office; He ſhould be an extraordinary Prophet, <hi>v.</hi> 76.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The work of this Prophet, with the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe he ſhould have in his work, <hi>v.</hi> 76, 77, &amp;c. <hi>Thou ſhalt go before the face of the Lord to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare his way, &amp;c.</hi> God that had raiſed him in an extraordinary manner, would bleſſe him with more them ordinary ſucceſſe, <hi>Many of</hi>

            <p>The words which I have read, are a part of that Prophecy which is uttered concerning Chriſt. They are a glorious title which <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> gives him before he was borne. <hi>A horne of ſalvation.</hi> From which title we gather this Note.</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt is a horne of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Elect.</hi> God hath raiſed him up for this very purpoſe, to be unto his Elect an horne of ſalvation. God hath raiſed up (ſaith he) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, he was not yet raiſed, but the time now drew neere; God had promiſed it. Faith looks on what God hath promiſed, as a thing already done. And then this phraſe [In the houſe of his ſervant <hi>David]</hi> is added, to ſhew the accompliſhment of the promiſe of Chriſt made to <hi>David</hi> God had often promiſed <hi>David,</hi> that he would raiſe up one out of his loynes, to ſit upon his Throne, and that his Kingdome in Chriſt ſhould be a perpetual Kingdome, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 5. <hi>Jer.</hi> 30. 9. Now at this time, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>David</hi> was even caſt down, the Scepter was even departed from <hi>Judah;</hi> the promiſes of God made to <hi>David</hi> ſeemed now to faile, his Kingdome was even broken, therefore is Chriſt ſaid here to be raiſed in the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> becauſe in Chriſt the Tabernacle of <hi>David</hi> was raiſed up, which was even fallen, according to that Prophecie, <hi>Amos</hi> 9. 11. And therefore Chriſt is called alſo the horn of <hi>David,</hi> Pſalm. 132. 17. becauſe he was raiſed up to fulfil the promiſe made to <hi>David,</hi> for the perpetuation of his Kingdome. And he is called <hi>the horne of the houſe of Iſrael,</hi>

            <p>Chriſt is ſalvation, 1. Privatively. Chriſt is ſalvation, 2. Poſitively.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He is a horne of ſalvation Privatively, in three reſpects.</p>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>In reſpect of ſinne.</hi> Sinne is a thing which doth much endanger the ſoules of the Elect. 'Tis indeed the onely great endangerer. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the devil nor men could endanger them, if it were not for ſinnes which betray them into the hands of both. There are three things in ſinne from which the Elect need to be ſaved.</p>
            <p n="1">(1) <hi>The guilt of ſinne.</hi> Guilt is the obligation of the ſinner to deſerved puniſhment. This doth every ſinne expoſe the ſinner unto, <hi>Lev.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3, 4. Now Jeſus Chriſt is ſalvation to them in reſpect of this. He hath taken all their guilt upon himſelf, and ſo freed them from it, ſo that though there be upon them ſimple guilt, yet

none that ſhall for ever redound upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of this ſalvation, <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

He ſaves them from then ſinne, by being made ſinne for them, as the Apoſtle ſpeake, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. From hence is the juſtification of our perſons in Gods ſight.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) <hi>The Dominion of ſinne.</hi> The Dominion of ſinne is the ſovereignty and command which ſinne exerciſeth over all men by nature. Hence it is that they are called <gap reason="foreign">

The Apoſtle uſeth this expreſſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 16, 17. <hi>To whom ye yield your ſelves ſervants to obey, his ſervants ye are to whom ye obey, &amp;c.</hi> Now Chriſt is a horn of ſalvation to them in this reſpect, for he doth by the communication of his Spirit undermine and aboliſh the Lordly dominion of ſinne, and by the infuſion of grace, and the communication of the Divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to them, cauſe them to become the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of righteouſneſſe. Of this the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 18. <hi>Being made free from ſinne, ye became the ſervants of righteouſneſſe.</hi> This is the work of Sanctification. Of this the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>Who gave himſelfe for us, that he might purifie us unto himſelfe, &amp;c.</hi> Chriſt takes off the yoke of ſinne, and puts on the neck the yoke of grace. This the Apoſtle fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 2. <hi>The Law of the Spirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus, hath made me free from the Law of ſin and death.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>In reſpect of Satan.</hi> Satan is a ſworne ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary to the Elect. He goeth about continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally like a roaring lion, ſeeking how he may devoure them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8. There are three things in reſpect whereof Chriſt is ſalvation to them from Satan.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Dominion of Satan.</hi> The Elect are by nature as well as others the bondſlaves of Satan, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 2. they are his ſervants by nature, and by their own voluntary ſinfulneſſe they have enſlaved themſelves to his bondage more: Of this the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 26. Now Jeſus Chriſt is ſalvation to the Elect from this eſtate. He doth at the converſion of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, cut the cords and unlooſe the chaines, by which the devil holds them faſt in bondage. Of this our Saviour ſpeaks, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 21. By his death he did triumph over him, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 15. and at the moment of our converſion, he doth actually put us into the poſſeſſion of this victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18. He doth then turn us <hi>from the power of Satan unto God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The temptations of Satan.</hi> Satan as he tempted Chriſt the Head, of which we reade, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 1, 2, 3. ſo doth he not ceaſe to aſſault and tempt all his members. The more viſible
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:38484:174"/>
Chriſts image is in any perſon, the more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently doth the devil aſſault him. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaks of this as in many other places, ſo ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 12. Now in this reſpect Chriſt is ſalvation to them. He ſtands by them, that theſe temptations may not prevaile over them. He interpoſeth himſelf between them and the teeth of this roaring lion; that he may not have his will on them. Of this our Saviour ſpeaks, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 31, 32.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The accuſations of Satan.</hi> The devil is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Scripture, <hi>The accuſer of the brethren,</hi> Rev. 12. 10. and he is a diligent creature at this work, for he accuſeth them day and night before the Lord. There are many imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and weakneſſes in the children of God, they do too often ſtep aſide out of Gods way, we have too many ſad inſtances of the truth of this in Scripture which I need not name. The Devil takes occaſion from theſe to accuſe us, not onely to men, but to God. He that turnes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſtone to hurry us into ſinne, doth when he hath overcome us, repreſent all to God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us in the uglieſt ſhape he can, that he may hinder mercy from us. Yes, he is ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious, that when he can have nothing viſibly to lay to our charge, he will pretend ſomething, as we ſee in the caſe of <hi>Job,</hi> Chap. 1. 9, &amp;c. Ch. 2. 4, &amp;c. Chriſt now is a horne of ſalvation to us in this reſpect; He ſtands continually pleading for us at Gods right hand; as ſoone as Satan puts in a Bill, Chriſt puts in an anſwer, and ſo doth caſt out and nullifie all his Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations. Thus is he ſalvation to them in reſpect of Satan.</p>

The great ones of the world, they riſe up often a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and vex them, &amp;c. Now Chriſt is ſalvation to them in this regard. Sometimes breaking the hornes that devoure them. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times melting the hearts of their devourers, making their enemies their friends. Sometimes removing them from them that would break them; alwayes delivering them from the evil and hurt of the attempts made againſt them, turning them for their greater and beſt good; He makes their vinegar better then their wine. Of this the Apoſtle was confident in his own caſe, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 19. <hi>This ſhall turne to my ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, through your prayer and the ſupply of the Spirit of Jeſus Christ.</hi> Chriſt is a horne even of temporal ſalvation to the Elect in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard.

are they ſaved from the general corruptions of wicked men, amongſt whom they live. Jeſus Chriſt keeps them from ſoyling themſelves as others do. This is that which is recorded of the Angel of the Church of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> Rev. 2. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This is put in amongſt the Catalogue of the ſufferings of the old Martyrs, that they were tempted, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 37. Chriſt the great Counſellor of his Church ſaved all theſe from yielding to ſuch temptations. Though they are ſometimes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnared, yet they are againe brought off by Chriſt from thoſe enſnarements, and Chriſt gives them power afterward the more to reſiſt them, and to abhor them.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Poſitively, Chriſt is ſalvation.</p>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>In reſpect of glory.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſalvation unto the Elect. All that ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which hath been mentioned before, is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to this which is the upſhot of all. He therefore ſaves them from ſinne, from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, from men, that he may bring them to this eternal happineſſe.

            <p n="3">3. He will actually put them into full poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it, when he returnes from heaven in the latter end of the world; of which he ſpeaks, <hi>John</hi> 14. 3. Thus much for the firſt particular, namely the extent of that ſalvation, of which Chriſt is ſaid to be an Horn. He is the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Elect Privatively from all evil; Poſitively to all good, till he have brought them to heaven the place of eternal ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Why Chriſt is called <hi>an Horn</hi> of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. That we may come to the full under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of this, let us conſider how the word is uſed in Scripture. Now we finde that this word doth Metaphorically denote two things e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Glory and dignity;</hi> So we finde it uſed, <hi>Lam.</hi> 2. 3. where the Church complaining of the miſery which had befallen her, hath theſe expreſſions, <hi>The Lord hath cut off in his fierce anger all the Horn of Iſrael,</hi> That is, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was glorious or excellent in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> God hath now removed. So we may ſee cleerly if we reade the firſt verſe. <hi>The Lord hath caſt down from heaven unto earth the beauty of Iſrael, he hath covered the daughter of Sion with a cloud, &amp;c.</hi> and then it follows, <hi>He hath cut off all the Horne of Iſrael.</hi> The glory of God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in his appearings, when he brought <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> is expreſſed by this Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:38484:176"/>
               <hi>Hab.</hi> 3. 3, 4. <hi>His glory covered the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, &amp;c. His brightneſſe was as the light, He had hornes coming out of his hand, &amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 10. <hi>My Horn,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt; ſhalt thou exalt like the horn of an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicorn;</hi> that is, thou ſhalt encreaſe my glory and dignity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Serength and Power.</hi> So 'tis uſed, <hi>Lam.</hi> 2. 17. <hi>He hath ſet up the horn of thine Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> ſaith the Church, that is, he hath encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the power and ſtrength of thine Adverſaries. So when God threatens to weaken the power of <hi>Moab,</hi> he doth it by this Metaphor, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 48. 25. <hi>The Horn of Moab is cut off, and his arme is broken.</hi> The breaking of the arme doth fully expound the cutting off of the Horn. And when God promiſeth to give his people pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to ſubdue their enemies; he uſeth this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, <hi>Micah</hi> 4. 13. <hi>Ariſe and threſh, &amp;c. for I will make thine horne Iron.</hi> Now then when Chriſt is called an Horn of ſalvation, the meaning of the Holy Ghoſt is,
<list>
                  <item>1. The glory of his ſalvation.</item>
                  <item>2. The ſtrength of his ſalvation.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>The glory of his ſalvation.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt is a glorious Saviour; and the ſalvation which he brings to his people is a glorious ſalvation, in three reſpects.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Conſider the perſon of Christ.</hi> God raiſed up many hornes of ſalvation for his people, when they were in diſtreſſe. The Hiſtory men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions them, <hi>Neh.</hi> 9. 27. <hi>According to thy mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold mercy thou gaveſt them Saviours which ſaved them.

               </gap> eyes of carnal men, yet they that had ſpiritual eyes did behold it, <hi>John</hi>

                  </gap> begotten of the Father.</hi> If the perſon of Chriſt be compared with the perſons of other ſaviours, it will appeare that he is a glorious Saviour. All other horns of ſalvation were but wooden horns, Chriſt is a golden Horn of ſalvation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Conſider the nature of the ſalvation it ſelf.</hi> 'Tis ſpiritual ſalvation, 'tis eternal ſalvation. All thoſe hornes of ſalvation, which were raiſed up in ſundry ages for the defence of the Church, were but horns of outward ſalvation, and of temporary ſalvation. They ſaved onely the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, and that neither but for a time. The Church was in as much peril after they had wrought ſalvation for them, as ever they were before. When <hi>Gideon</hi> was dead, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael</hi> fell into as great danger as they were in before. So after the death of <hi>Jepthah,</hi> and after the death of <hi>Sampſon,</hi> they were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verwhelmed with as great hazards as before, as you may reade in the ſtory in the book of <hi>Judges.</hi> But now Chriſt is a Horn of ſalvation to their ſoules, as well as to their bodies. He ſaves them from their ſpiritual enemies, Sinne, Satan, as well as from men. He ſaves them from the wrath to come, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 10. And then he ſaves them for ever. The Church ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver can be, never will be in that danger again as they were before this Horn of ſalvation was raiſed. <hi>He hath for ever perfected them that are ſanctified,</hi> Heb. 10. 14.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="336" facs="tcp:38484:177"/>
3. <hi>Conſider the glorious manner of the working of this ſalvation.</hi> Never any ſalvation ſo glorious at this. There are three things in it.</p>
            <p n="1">(1) <hi>He ſaved the Elect by his own power.</hi> The power by which all other hornes of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion delivered the Church, was by a power one of themſelves; the ſtrength they had was none of their own, but the power by which Chriſt ſaved, and ſtill ſaves his Church, is from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; the Divinity impowered the Humanity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 98. 1. <hi>His own right hand, and his own ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Arme hath gotten him the victory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2) <hi>He ſaved the Elect ſolely.</hi> Other horns of ſalvation had the concurrence of many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides themſelves, <hi>Gideon,</hi> and <hi>Jepthah,</hi> and <hi>Sampſon,</hi> &amp;c. They blew the trumpet and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered multitudes, to aſſiſt them in the battels which they fought for the ſalvation of the Church. All <hi>Iſrael</hi> came after them: But this Horn of ſalvation wrought the Churches deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance alone, <hi>Eſay</hi> 63. 3, 5. <hi>I have troden the wine-preſſe alone, &amp;c.</hi> He had no other Horne to help him; He entred the field, and fought the battel alone, and by himſelf obtained the victory.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>He ſaved the Church by his own death.</hi> Other hornes of ſalvation delivered the Church by the death of the enemy. <hi>Ehud</hi> ſlew <hi>Eglon,</hi> but he himſelf did not die, <hi>Iudges</hi> 3. 21, 22. <hi>Gideon</hi> ſhew <hi>Zeha</hi> and <hi>Zalmunna</hi> the enemies of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Judges 8. 21. but he himſelf was not ſlain. But now this Horn of ſalvation got the victory by dying, his Croſſe was his Conqueſt. He <hi>tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed over principalities and powers on the Croſſe,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 15. He ſubdued

               </gap> he works for his people hath ſtrength in it. <hi>He hath raiſed up a mighty ſalvation for us;</hi> ſo ſome tranſlations render this text. To this agrees that of the Prophet, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 19. <hi>I have laid help upon one that is mighty, I have exalted one cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen out of the people.</hi> When God committed our ſalvation to Chriſt, he committed it to one that was mighty. Chriſt is not a reed of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but a rock of ſalvation. A ſtrong Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, as the Scripture calls him, <hi>Ierem:</hi> 50. 34. Conſider four things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>What ſtrong enemies Chriſt was to vanquiſh, that he might ſave us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1) He was to ſave us from ſinne. Now ſin was very ſtrong, it grew faſt and deep in the heart. Sinne is interwoven in the very conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of every man. Chriſt could not ſave the Elect, if he did not pluck up the very roots of ſinne. He was to ſave them from the guilt, from the power, from the filthineſſe, yea from the very being of ſinne. Had he not been very ſtrong, he could not have ſubdued ſuch a potent enemy as ſinne was.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) He was to ſave them from the devil. The devil is called in Scripture, <hi>The ſtrong man,</hi> yea, <hi>the ſtrong man armed,</hi> Luke 11. 21. One devil hath more ſtrength then all the men in the world, and there are many Legions of
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:38484:178"/>
devils which are in the poſſeſſion of the Elect by nature. The devils are called principalities and powers, for the greatneſſe of their ſtrength, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 12. Jeſus Chriſt, if he had not been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrong, could never have routed theſe migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſpirits. Conſider,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The manner how he was to ſave us.</hi> He was to beare and undergo the wrath of his Father for his Elect; a heavy burthen, which they were notable to bear. The grappling with ſinne and Satan was but eaſie in reſpect of this, to beare the wrath of God without ſinking. The Prophet ſpeaks of this, <hi>Eſay</hi> 53. 5, 6. all the puniſhment of the ſinnes of men was laid on Chriſt. <hi>He treadeth the wine-preſſe of the fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and wrath of Almighty God,</hi> Rev. 19. 15. There it's ſpoken of him as the Executioner of his Fahters wrath, but he did firſt tread it as a ſufferer. And he did beare all this alone. And he was to undergo it without ſinking and fainting. Had he not been a ſtrong ſalvation, he had periſhed under this burden. To beare the wrath of God, is a greater work then the ſubduing of all the devils ſtrength. He could have done this by a word; but to ſatisfie the juſtice of his Father, could not be done without his perſonal ſuffering. Conſider</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The multitude of the perſons he was to ſave.</hi> Thouſands and millions, an innumerable mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude the Scripture affirmes them to be, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 9. All the Elect of God which did then live; yea, all that had been, all that ſhould be to the end of the world. Had he not been a ſtrong Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, he could not have ſaved ſo many. And (which doth ſhew his ſtrength more) All theſe were at firſt unwilling to be ſaved by him. The

            <p n="4">4. <hi>The perfection and fulneſſe of his ſalvation.</hi> His ſalvation is a compleat ſalvation. This is that which the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. <hi>He is able to ſave</hi>

               </gap> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Divine Nature was not capable of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that way that ſalvation muſt be wrought, namely by ſuffering. God therefore fitted Chriſt with a body, in which body by the grace of perſonal union the God-head was cauſed to dwell. Of this the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 5. <hi>Sacrifice and meat-offering thou wouldest not have, but a body haſt thou fitted me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>By conferring upon the humane nature ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of all thoſe ſpiritual qualifications and endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which were neceſſary for him, to the carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of his work.</hi> Strength, wiſdome, judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, mercy, love, patience and many other graces were needful for this work of ſalvation. God therefore furniſhed Jeſus Chriſt with all theſe, <hi>Eſay</hi> 11. 1, 2, 3. And as he had variety of all theſe graces, ſo did God beſtow upon him a fulneſſe, of all theſe; not a limited, ſtint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fulneſſe, as he beſtowed upon others; but an unmeaſurable fulneſſe of all grace; A ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of redundancy, which from him might flow out to all the Elect for the filling of them with a fulneſs of ſufficiency. Of this the Scripture ſpeaks, <hi>John</hi> 3. 34. and <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 16. In all theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects God hath raiſed him up to be a Horne of ſalvation.

Not onely Jewes, and Turks, and Pagans, but all unbeleevers in the Church. Whoſoever is without true ſaving faith, is without Chriſt. 'Tis faith that makes Chriſt Actually ours Faith unites us to Chriſt, and Chriſt to us. Their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery is very great. Chriſt is a horn of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the onely Horn of ſalvation; he that is without Chriſt, is without ſalvation: God hath put the ſalvation of men into Chriſts hands, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 11. <hi>He hath given us eternal life, and this life is in his Sonne.</hi> And <hi>he that hath the Sonne hath life; but he that hath not the Son hath not life,</hi> ver. 12. God himſelf cannot ſave him that is without an intereſt in Chriſt. He hath ſet down this way of ſalvation, and he cannot deny himſelf. It is a queſtion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Schoolmen, whether God could have ſaved ſinners without Chriſts ſatisfaction. They generally conclude upon good grounds that he might; but now 'tis not ſo much as a queſtion. God hath reſolved, that whoſoever is ſaved, ſhall be ſaved by Chriſt; and without mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability, he cannot ſave men another way. Better never to have ſeen the light, then to die without an intereſt in Chriſt. And he that doth not beleeve truely in him, hath no ſaving intereſt in him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 18. How ſhall I know whether I do truly beleeve or no? I ſhall here to help you, lay down a twofold note of true faith.</p>

Faith applies this promiſe and improves, and ſo purifies the heart. If you have not purification of heart, you have not faith; and if you have not faith, you have not Chriſt as a Horne of ſalvation. Now that heart may be ſaid to be purified, that hath theſe three pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>If it bewaile impurity.</hi> Impurity that is truly lamented, is in Gods account as if it were removed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 23, 24. If thy pollution be thy greateſt burden, thy heart is purified in Gods ſight.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>If it be cautious of every thing that may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file.</hi> A heart that is purified, dares not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly come neere any defiling puddle, it will avoid occaſions, temptations of defilement, <hi>Iob</hi> 31. 1.

               <p>2. <hi>Saving faith hath very high and precious thoughts of Chriſt.</hi> This character is laid down by the Apoſtle, in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 7. No unbeleever can tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have precious thoughts of Chriſt, nay they

               <p n="2">(2) <hi>If Chriſt be truly precious to thee, his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honours will pierce thy ſoul.</hi> The diſhonours done to him in his truths, worſhip, govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will be a greater grief to thy heart then all the diſhonours that are done unto thy ſelfe.</p>

               <p n="2">(2) <hi>Chriſt did not conquer for the Devil,</hi> but from the Devil; Chriſt will not be at the charge and coſt of redemption, and when he hath done, ſuffer the devil to go away with the ſpoile.</p>

               </gap> There is a foure-fold deſcending of Chriſt which the Scripture mentions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>His incarnation, the manifeſtation of himſelfe in the fleſh.</hi>
            </p>

Of this deſcenſion the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 6, 7.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The ſubjecting of himſelf to death.</hi> His a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding under the power of the grave for three dayes and three nights. This is the loweſt piece of his deſcenſion. Of this the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Eph</hi> 4. 9. <hi>In that he aſcended, what is it but that he alſo deſconded firſt into the lowest parts of the earth?</hi> Theſe deſcenſions or comings down of Chriſt are included one in another. When he took our nature upon him he did truly deſcend. Not as if the Divine nature came where it was not before, but becauſe God did in the incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Chriſt, manifeſt himſelf after ſuch a manner as he never had done before; For God cannot properly be ſaid to aſcend or deſcend; he being a moſt ſimple and ſpiritual Eſſence, is not moved from place to place as creatures are, but he is ſaid to aſcend or deſcend in regard of the manifeſtation of his preſence, either by the effects of his preſence, or by viſible ſpecies or ſhapes, which appearing or diſappearing,

            <p n="4">(4) <hi>There is another deſcenſion which we ſhall rather expound this of: the diſtillations of his grace, and ſpiritual bleſſings upon his Church.</hi> Theſe indeed are glorious deſcenſions. When Chriſt lets fall the influences of his grace, then doth he come down in a glorious manner. Every drop of grace is a Metaphorical deſcenſion. Chriſt doth ſpiritually come down, when he lets any ſpiritual vertue drop down in his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances upon the ſouls of his people. Of this kinde of deſcenſion the Church ſpeaks, <hi>Eſay</hi> 64. 1.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>The raine is the immediate and proper work of God</hi> The Scripture doth by this put a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between the true God, and Idols, <hi>Jer.</hi> 14. 22. Man can neither ſet abroach the veſſels of heaven to cauſe raine, nor can he ſtop them when God hath ſet them abroach. The key of the raine hangs at Gods girdle. Man may ſpeak long enough to the clouds before they give a drop of moiſture, but if God do but lift up his finger they are diſſolved. As he brings forth the wine our of his treaſures, ſo doth he draw the raine out of his Cellars. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:38484:188"/>
Chriſt comes down like the raine in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, for he is the immediate and proper gift of God. This raine had never fallen from heaven, if God had not of his own accord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed it; had all the Angels of God been conven'd in an Aſſembly, how to reſtore loſt man, they could never have found out this way. The Scripture attributes the whole work of giving Chriſt to God alone. <hi>My Doctrine is not mine,</hi> Joh. 7. 16. <hi>but his that ſent me.</hi> His Doctrine is from God <hi>John</hi> 12. 49 His Scepter is from God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. 2. His King he is called, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 6. He prepared him a body, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 5. This raine hath no Father but God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The raine is very uſeful to the earth.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt is very uſeful to his Church. Conſider this in five particulars</p>
               <p n="1">(1) <hi>The raine hath a cooling vertue.</hi> When the aire is heated through the ſcortching beams of the Sunne, the raine doth refreſh and coole it; we find a great cooling after one nights rain, even in the heat of Summer. Jeſus Chriſt hath a cooling vertue, when the ſoul burnes with luſt, when it is ſcortched with fiery temptations, one ſhower from Jeſus Chriſt cools it againe. Jeſus Chriſt by the droppings of his Doctrine, and by the ſecret diſtillations of his grace, quencheth the unholy heats of the ſoule. God complaines of his people; that they are as <hi>an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven heated by the Baker,</hi> Hoſ. 7. 4 The beſt of Gods children finde in themſelves ſuch inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate heats. Sometimes they burn with world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, ſometimes they are hot with envyings, ſometimes they rage with paſſion and diſtemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed anger. <hi>Jonah</hi> had a flame of anger in his

ſoule, when he fell ſo foul upon God, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>init.</hi> There's no way to extinguiſh ſuch burnings, but by the cooling drops of Jeſus Chriſt; he ſends down a ſhower upon the heart, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o brings it to its own temper againe. How did Chriſt cool <hi>Paul</hi> when unconverted, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 1, 3, 4.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) <hi>The raine hath a mollifying nature.</hi> When the earth is like iron under our feet by long droughts or hard froſts, a few good ſhowers ſupple it, and make it tender, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 65. 10. <hi>David</hi> ſpeaking of the earth, ſaith, <hi>Thou makeſt it ſoft with ſhowers.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt hath a ſoften<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vertue; ſometimes the heart is hardened by the deceitfulneſſe of ſinne. The ſoul is like the froſty earth, no hammers will break it, no judgements will diſſolve it; at ſuch a time a few drops from Jeſus Chriſt will ſoften it. The heart of <hi>Peter</hi> was once grown as hard as a ſtone, he denies Chriſt, forſwears Chriſt, curſes himſelf if ever he knew him, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 55, 56, &amp;c. no ſooner doth Jeſus Chriſt open the cloud, and raine upon him, but he melts into teares, <hi>v.</hi> 61. The heart of the Church was once fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen very hard. Chriſt comes and knocks, ſhe ſleeps, he continues knocking, ſhe gives him a ſcornful anſwer, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 2, 3. no ſooner had he let fall ſome drops of myrth, but ſhe is ſoften<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>v.</hi> 4. Before, her bowels were troubled at his knocking, but now her bowels are more troubled that ſhe made him knock twice. Chriſts Word and his Spirit have a ſoftening power and vertue; the unconverted hardneſſe of the heart is moll<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>fied by this rain. If Chriſt would but now drop a few drops from heaven, the verieſt flint in the Congregation would be turned into a
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:38484:189"/>
fountaine of waters. How comes the ſtony heart to be turned into an heart of fleſh, but becauſe theſe ſhowers fall upon it? One good ſhower of this raine upon the heart of a <hi>Judas</hi> would make it like melting wax. And then,</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The raine hath a cleanſing vertue.</hi> A good ſhower makes the very chanels cleane, ſtore of raine makes the very ſinks ſweet. You ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the fields have a ſweet perfume after rain. Jeſus Chriſt hath a cleanſing and ſweetning vertue. Thoſe hearts that are as filthy as ſinks, thoſe ſoules that are as naſty and ſtinking as your common ſhores, after a good ſhower of this raine, are both cleane and fragrant. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Magdalen</hi> was a very ſink of ſinne, ſhe was full of devils; yet when this raine fell powerfully upon her, how cleane was ſhe? See what the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9, 10, 11. What a company of filthy creatures are theſe? For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicators, Idolaters, &amp;c. yet <hi>v.</hi> 11. one good ſhower waſheth theſe cleane. Chriſt hath a cleanſing vertue. Let the ſoule be never ſo le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous or filthy, a few good ſhowers from him will make it cleane; The Prophet calls him <hi>a fountaine for ſinne and for uncleanneſſe,</hi> Zech. 13. 1. And then,</p>
               <p n="4">(4) <hi>The raine hath a fructifying vertue.</hi> The feed which is ſowen doth not thrive, the graſſe in the paſtures doth not grow, if God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold raine. All the labour of the husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man comes to nothing, if either the former or the latter raine be denied. The <hi>Pſalmist</hi> ſets out this vertue of the raine, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. want of raine brings a famine upon the earth. Thoſe three yeares of famine, which followed
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:38484:190"/>
one after another in the dayes of <hi>David,</hi> were occaſioned by want of raine, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 1. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>v.</hi> 10. The ſonnes of <hi>Saul</hi> were to be hanged, till God by ſending raine, did ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie that he was appeaſed. The raine is the very life of the fruits of the earth; the clouds are the ſucking-bottle of the fruits of the earth; they dwindle if theſe bottles continue for any ſpace ſtopped up. See <hi>Jer.</hi> 14. 4, 6. There is in Jeſus Chriſt a fructifying vertue. He makes the barren ſoul bring forth, and be a fruitful mother of children. See <hi>v.</hi> 16. after the text, <hi>John</hi> 15. 5. <hi>He that abideth in me and I in him, the ſame bringeth forth much fruit.</hi> The Word of Chriſt is a fructifying word. The Spirit of Chriſt is a fructifying Spirit; the Church is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the fructifying vertue of Chriſt, therefore ſhe goes to him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. 16. if Chriſt do not raine, there will be no fruits: but if Chriſt will drop down his dew, the paſtures will be green. All the labour and paines of the ſpiritual husbandman will come to nothing, if the raine come not down from Chriſt. And if he pleaſe to poure down ſhowers, let not the Eunuch ſay, <hi>I am a dry tree.</hi> Though your heart be as dry and withered as the rod of <hi>Aaron</hi> was; yet if Chriſt will raine upon it, it ſhall both bud, and bloſſom, and bring forth Almonds. The husbandman uſeth to ſay of his corne in a time of long drought, that it is ſtocked, yet that corne when the raine comes, will ſhoot up. Grace is ſometimes ſtockt in the ſoul; yet if Chriſt rain plentifully upon it, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> will get up and gather ſtrength again. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> grace was ſtockt, when he lay ſleeping in his blood, and uncleanneſſe, for ſo many months
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:38484:190"/>
together; yet when God opened this cloud and poured moyſture upon him, he revived.</p>
               <p n="5">(5.) <hi>The raine hath a recreating <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> of men, and it begets a kinde of briskneſſe in the ſenſitive creatures: the birds chirp, the beaſts of the field rejoyce in their kinde: yea, there is a kinde of joy in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry inanimate creatures. The Prophet ſpeaks of this in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65. 13. <hi>The paſtures are cloathed with flocks, the valleys are covered over with corne: they ſhout for joy, they alſo ſing.</hi> When raine comes after a long drought, there is me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody made by all creatures in this lower world. Jeſus Chriſt hath a cheering vertue, he doth fill the ſoul with joy when he comes down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſoule. The heart that was dead, and dull, and heavy, is made pleaſant and joyful, when theſe ſhowers fall upon it. When Jeſus Chriſt comes to the ſoul, he brings joy to the ſoule, <hi>Eſay</hi> 9. 3. <hi>They joy before thee, according to the joy in harveſt, and as mon rejoyce when they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the ſpoile.</hi> When the Eunuch had his ſoul bedewed with this raine, <hi>He went on his way rejaycing,</hi> Acts 8. 39. The ground of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing you may ſee, <hi>v.</hi> 32, 33, 35. <hi>Philip</hi> had acquainted him with Chriſt, and Chriſt upon <hi>Philips</hi> preaching had rained down a ſoaking ſhower upon his ſoule, that created a holy gladneſſe in his heart. Chriſt is the onely cheerer of the heart. He can remove ſpiritual melancholy, he can take off ſpiritual heavineſs, and put unſpeakable joy into the ſoule. 'Tis true, many of the members of Chriſt want ſpiritual joy. This ariſeth either from the reſtraining of this raine, or from their not diſcerning of
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:38484:191"/>
this raine. When ever the diſtreſſed ſoul ſhall come to the feeling of theſe ſhowers, it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce and be no more ſad. The Doctrine of Chriſt is a cheering Doctrine. The whole Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> a Doctrine of good tidings. All the Ordinances of Chriſt are cheering Ordinances. <hi>I will make them joyful in my houſe of prayer.</hi> God hath planted Jeſus Chriſt as a root of joy to his people. As he is a plant of ſalvation, ſo he is a plant of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, no joy is either real or laſting, which is not bottomed upon Jeſus Chriſt. That ſoul that hath received this raine into his heart ſhall have ſome joy here, and he ſhall have everlaſting, full, ſoul-ſatisfying joy in Chriſt, and with Chriſt, and from Chriſt in the other world. This is the ſecond, Chriſt is like raine in reſpect of uſefulneſſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Chriſt is like the raine, if we conſider the manner of its deſcending.</hi> There is a great ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude between the manner of Chriſts deſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon the ſoule, and the deſcenſion of the rain upon the earth. I ſhal inſtance in ſeven particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>The raine comes down ſucceſſively and gradually, now a little and then a little.</hi> The raine doth not fall down all at once; but it comes now a ſhower, and then a ſhower, as the earth ſtands in need of it. God pierces now one cloud, and then another in a pleaſant ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion. Jeſus Chriſt comes now a little and then a little, as the condition of the ſoule re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires. A drop in one Ordinance, and a drop in another Ordinance. A ſhower falls in this Sermon, and a ſhower at another Sermon. This is that which the Prophet mentions, <hi>Eſay</hi> 28. 10. <hi>Precept muſt be upon precept, line upon</hi>
                  <pb n="365" facs="tcp:38484:191"/>
                  <hi>line, here a little and there a little.</hi> Now one comforting influence comes down and then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; now one quickning impulſion, then another; now one promiſe is rained down, then another.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> would have his people in a conſtant dependance on himſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) He would have them wait conſtantly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every Ordinance.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) He would not have them ſurfet, either upon his Doctrines or comforts, therefore he obſerves a ſucceſſion in his diſtillations of good things upon them.</p>
               <p n="4">(4) He would have every Doctrine, and every comfort ſoak into their hearts, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 44.</p>
               <p n="5">(5) Chriſt would have nothing loſt, which he is pleaſed to beſtow.</p>
               <p n="6">(6) Chriſt would endear every drop of his grace to his people.</p>
               <p n="7">(7) The ſoules of his people are like narrow mouth'd veſſels, they cannot receive much at once without ſpilling.</p>
               <p n="8">(8) We are ſuch bad husbands, that Chriſt dares not truſt us with much at once. For theſe and ſuch like reaſons, doth he cauſe all he gives, to diſtill in a way of ſucceſſion. Jeſus Chriſt doth in a way of wiſdome, parcel out all the good which he raines down upon the ſouls of his people.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The rain comes down irreſiſtibly.</hi> When God doth by his Word of command ſpeak to the cloud to diſtil its moiſture upon the earth, it is not in the power of all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in heaven and earth to hinder its falling down. As the clouds cannot open their own veines till God give the word, no more can

Jeſus Chriſt comes down upon the hearts of men with an irreſiſtible power and efficacy, whether we underſtand it of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, or of his Scepter, or of the influences of his Spirit, he doth deſcend with a forcible and mighty power. His Word is called a powerful Word, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 12. <hi>The Word of the Lord is quick and powerful,</hi>

                  </gap>ſtibility of grace; the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture mentions no ſuch thing: the raine will come down whether men will or no; and let the earth be never ſo hard, it will ſoak into it. When Chriſt by his Word and Spirit deſcends, it is with a mighty power, that the ſoul is not able to reſiſt it. I ſhall ſhew the power of Chriſts Word, Spirit and Scepter, in three great works;</p>
               <p>Conviction, Converſion, Conſolation. To ſpeak particularly to theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>For Conviction.</hi> When Chriſt comes down with an intention, thoroughly to convince the conſcience, of ſinne and righteouſneſſe; the ſoul though it may ſtand out for a time, yet it is through the mighty ſmitings of Chriſts Word and Spirit ſo powerfully over-ruled, that it cannot but yield: we have an inſtance of this in <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 9. 6. Jeſus Chriſt doth with ſuch an invincible evidence come upon his conſcience; that though he was in a violent motion carried on in a
<pb facs="tcp:38484:192"/>
contrary courſe, yet he yields up himſelfe as a priſoner into his hands, crying out, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me do?</hi> He hath no ſtrength to ſtand out any longer, nay not ſo much as to diſpute it with Chriſt. Of this convincing power the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 24, 25. Jeſus Chriſt, when he comes down with a purpoſe to bridle the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, doth deal ſo effectually, that the proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſinner is brought upon his knees, and made to paſſe ſentence againſt himſelf. Yea, with ſuch a mighty power doth he come down upon the ſoule, that even thoſe who are not ſavingly brought in, have their mouths ſtopped, and are unable to ſay any thing for themſelves. Thus it was with thoſe that brought the woman taken in the act of Adultery, to Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 8. 9. They were ſo mightily convicted by the Word and Spirit of Chriſt, that they were not able to abide in his preſence, but ſhrunk away one by one as men ſelf-condemned. Thus it was when Chriſt deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended in the word of Stephen, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 10. Though they would not yield, yet they were ſo powerfully convinced, that they could not reſiſt the Spirit by which he ſpake. Chriſt doth ſo demonſtratively ſmite the conſcience, that carnal reaſoning hath no door of evaſion. Of this powerful conviction we may underſtand that of the Prophet, <hi>Eſay</hi> 11. 4. Where ſpeaking of Chriſt he ſaith, that <hi>he ſhall ſmite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips ſhall ſlay the wicked.</hi> When Chriſt ſets upon the work of conviction; he comes with ſo much efficacy; that he ſmites ſome to ſubmiſſion, all to ſilence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>For Converſion.</hi> When Chriſt deſcends upon the ſoul in the work of Converſion;
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:38484:193"/>
what ſtrength doth he put forth? the ſtrong holds of ſinne are battered down, every high thing that exalts it ſelf againſt the knowledge of Chriſt, is brought into captivity, to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of his Scepter, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. Devils are caſt out of the poſſeſſion which they have kept for many yeares without the leaſt diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Strong luſts are mortified, and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſtitution of the ſoul is changed. <hi>What aileth thee O thou ſea, that thou fleddeſt, thou Jordan that thou wast driven back? ye moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines that ye skipped like rams, &amp;c.</hi> Pſ. 114. 5, 6. The Prophet ſpeaks thoſe words of the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful entrance of the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> into <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan.</hi> The like is done by Chriſt in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of a ſinner. <hi>Jordan</hi> is driven back, the whole courſe of the ſoul is altered, The moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines skip like rams; There are many moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines in the ſoul of a ſinner, as p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Theſe mountains are plucked up by the roots in a moment, when Chriſt begins the work of Converſion. See how the Prophet doth allegorically ſet out the powerful deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt in this work, <hi>Eſay</hi> 11 6, 7, 8. <hi>The wolf ſhall dwell with the lamb, &amp;c.</hi> All the woolviſh, ravenous and brutiſh qualities and affections of the ſoul are powerfully ſubdued and brought under. All that have known a perſon before, wonder at the great change which is wrought, and he wonders more at himſelfe then all others can do. Chriſt put his bridle of power into his lips, and turned the current of his ſoul he ſcarce knows how. When Chriſt came upon the heart of <hi>Eliſha,</hi> what a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty power was put forth, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19. 19, 20, 21.
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:38484:193"/>
                  <hi>Elijah</hi> caſts his mantle upon him, the Spirit of Chriſt deſcends in that action, and ſee how the man is changed. He left the oxen and ran after <hi>Elijah,</hi> forſakes all his friends to wait upon the Prophet. When Chriſt by his Word and Spirit deſcends upon the heart of the Jay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, what a ſtrange work is wrought upon him! <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 33, He takes the Apoſtles the very ſame houre and waſhes their ſtripes. Had any one that had over-night ſeen him beating the Apoſtles ſo cruelly as he did, told him, well, before the morning-light thou ſhalt wiſh that all thoſe ſtripes had been upon thy own body, thou ſhalt before the Sunne ariſe waſh thoſe bloody ſtripes with thy tears; would not he have thought him mad? and yet all this came to paſſe. Jeſus Chriſt comes down with ſo much power, that though the will would ſtand out againſt him, yet it cannot reſiſt. Many a perſon comes to Church, perhaps with an intention to laugh at the Preacher; Chriſt poures down a ſhower upon him, which hath ſo much power, that he that came a ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, departs a mourner. <hi>Zacheus</hi> is upon the Sycamore tree, Jeſus Chriſt lets a few drops upon him, and he is ſo powerfully ſubdued, that he comes down ſpeedily at the firſt call, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 5, 6. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſits at the Exciſe-office gathering tribute<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chriſt raines down but one ſhower, and that hath ſo much power, that the man leaves all and follows him, he cannot ſtay to take one mans money more, he ariſeth from his profitable ſeat, and runnes after Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. 9, 10. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Andrew</hi> are buſie (as Chriſt paſſes by) mending their nets: Chriſt diſtils a few drops upon them in that call of

his, <hi>Follow me and I will make you fiſhers of men,</hi> and how mightily are they overpowered! they will not ſtay one tyde more, yea they will not give another ſtitch, but ariſe and follow him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 18, 19, 20.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>For Conſolation.</hi> When Chriſt comes down with a purpoſe to comfort a ſadded heart, he comforts it with power. See the promiſe, <hi>Eſay</hi> 66. 13. <hi>I will comfort you, and ye ſhall be comforted.</hi> The Conſolations of the Word and Spirit of Chriſt come with ſuch efficacy, that the ſoul cannot ſhut them out, the mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is preſently turned into dancing. The Conſolations of Chriſt are called ſtrong conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 18. not onely in regard of the matter of them, but in regard of the reception of them; where ever they come, they come with ſtrength. <hi>Hannah</hi> is in bitterneſſe of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit for a time; Jeſus Chriſt doth but, as ſhe is at prayer, poure down a few freſh drops upon her; and ſhe goes away, and is no more ſad, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> ſtands at the Sepulchre full of ſorrow, ſhe weeps many a bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="371" facs="tcp:38484:194"/>
Thirdly, <hi>The raine comes down voluntarily, undeſervedly.</hi> The Prophet tells us how the dew and ſhowers fall; <hi>They tarry not for man, nor wait for the ſonnes of men,</hi> Micah 7. 5. The raine doth not expect any humane concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence or cauſality. Though it come down upon us, yet it comes down without us. The raine deſcends for our advantage, but not for our deſerving. The diſtillation of Chriſt comes down undeſervedly on our part. The ſoule meets with many a ſhower from Chriſt, when it deſerves no ſuch thing. The good either of Chriſts Doctrine, or his Scepter, or his Spirit are not merited by us. Should we have no raine from Chriſt till we did deſerve it, we ſhould ſuffer an eternal drought. The firſt grace of Chriſt is preventing grace. <hi>I am found of them that ſought not after me,</hi> Eſay 65. 1. And all the after-grace of Chriſt, is undeſerved grace. We do as little to deſerve the influences of Chriſt, as we do to deſerve the diſtillations of the clouds. All that Chriſt doth for us is onely from the meer motion of his own grace, <hi>Eſay</hi> 55. 1. <hi>Of his own will begat he us by the word of truth,</hi> James 1. 18. We muſt ſay, Grace, grace to all the ſoul-fatning drops that come from Chriſt. He forgets that Chriſt comes down as the rain, that dreams of merit. All the ſonnes of men want Chriſt, but none of the ſonnes of men can deſerve Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>The raine comes down unexpected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> Sometimes when the skie is black with clouds, the winde riſeth and driveth them away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſo much as a drop: At another time the raine falls plentifully when no ſhower is expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Jeſus Chriſt comes down upon the ſoules
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:38484:195"/>
of his people many times, when they look for no influences from him; the Church obſerves this, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6. 11, 12. <hi>I went down into the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of nuts, to ſee the fruits of the valley, and to ſee whether the vine flouriſhed, and the pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granates budded. Or ever I was aware, my ſoul made me like the chariots of Aminadab.</hi> Here a ſhower fell upon her head when ſhe did not look for it. The ſoul ſometimes comes to an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ful of miſgiving thoughts, expecting no good; and before it depart, it's wet from top to toe with the diſtillations of Chriſts Spirit. The Church found it ſo, when ſhe had the leaſt reaſon that could be to expect it, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 5. She might have expected to have found flames of brimſtone in regard of her dealings with Chriſt, and behold ſhe findes the droppings of ſweet-ſmelling myrrh. Sometimes in the night-watches Chriſt raines upon the ſoule, when it, never expects any ſuch thing. <hi>David</hi> made his bed to ſwim, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 6. 6. he could not have watered his couch with his teares, if Chriſt had not firſt watered his heart with his grace. Sometimes the ſoule comes to the Throne of grace parched with hardneſſe, perhaps as dry as the rock in the Wilderneſſe, and Chriſt ſuddenly ſends down a ſhower, that it goes ſavour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y weeping from his preſence. <hi>Did not our hearts burne within us, while he talked with us by the way?</hi> Luke 24. 32. Jeſus Chriſt did deſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>end ſuddenly upon them while they were in conference with him. Sometimes a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God takes the book of God into his hand, when his ſoul is dry and withered, and before he hath read half a Chapter, he findes the clouds melting, and his ſoul bedewed with a
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:38484:195"/>
ſhower of grace, never did a ſhower comedown ſo ſuddenly, as the grace of Chriſt hath ſometimes comedown upon the ſoul.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>The raine comes down not for its own benefit, but for the benefit of the earth.</hi> What advantage hath the cloud by all the moiſture that drops down from it? It empties it ſelfe that it may enrich the ground. Jeſus Chriſt doth by his Word, and Spirit, and Scepter, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend for the benefit of men. His Doctrine, the influences of his Grace, are for the enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Elect. Chriſt came down at firſt in his incarnation for our ſakes, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 9. and all his other deſcenſions are for our good. For the filling of our empty ſoules, for the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of our dead ſouls, for the comforting of our ſtraitned and diſtreſſed ſouls, it is that Chriſt comes ſtill down into the world. His preaching, his knocking, his ſtriving is onely and meerly for our benefit. <hi>What profit is it to God, that thou are righteous?</hi> Job 22. 3. Chriſt hath no more advantage by all the drops he ſends down upon thy ſoule, then the clouds have for all the ſhowers they let fall upon the earth.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>The rain comes down variouſly ſometimes after a more ſtormy manner, ſometimes after a milder manner.</hi> Chriſt comes down ſomtimes by promiſes, comforts, enlargments in a way of mildneſs; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he deſcends in a way of ſeverity, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes, threatnings. The Church hath as much need of ſtormy ſhowers as milder ſhowers, of cold raine as of warmer drops. Chriſts more angry drops are as uſeful for his people, as his more pleaſant drops. His chiding and frowning diſtillations make his comforting
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:38484:196"/>
droppings more ſweet. His milder ſhowers comfort us, but his ſtormy ſhowers try us more; If Chriſt ſhould not rebuke us as well as comfort us, he would indeed loſe us. The great raine of his anger keeps us from ſtragling, when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he ſmall raine of his love occaſions us to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, <hi>The raine comes down plentifully.</hi> Not a drop or two, but whole ſhowers. Though it come not down all at once, yet as much comes down as is uſeful for the earth. Jeſus Chriſt comes down plentifully, he doth not ſcant the ſoul, he doth not give one comfort, but many comforts. <hi>Eat O friends, drink abundantly,</hi> Cant. 5. 1. He hath enough in him to give. The ſoul wants more then a little. He is not niggardly, but bountiful, therefore he gives plentifully; and then as the raine falls down in many places at once, ſo doth Chriſt. All the earth for many miles together is ſometimes rained upon at o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e and the ſame time; the rain wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters many fields at once. Jeſus Chriſt comes down abundantly; he can, if he pleaſe, water many ſoules, yea many Congregations at once. So many Churches, ſo many Fleeces; ſo many Congregations, ſo many Paſtures. Chriſt can rain upon this Congregation, and he can water other Congregations at the ſame time. Jeſus Chriſt, if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e pleaſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> one and the ſame time. As the drops of a ſhower cannot be numbred, no more can the drops which fall from Jeſus Chriſt upon his Church. If we receive not plentifully from Chriſt, 'tis becauſe we ask not plentifully.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="375" facs="tcp:38484:196"/>
For the third particular. <hi>Quae diſproportio?</hi> And here I ſhall ſhew the excellency of Chriſt above all material raine, in ſix particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Chriſt comes down from the higheſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens.</hi> The raine deſcends from the viſible hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens. Philoſophers divide the aire into three Regions; the higheſt, the middle, and the loweſt Region. Now they all hold that the raine deſcends onely from the middle Region<hi>:</hi> there it is generated, and from thence it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends upon the earth. But now Jeſus Chriſt comes down from the inviſible Heavens. There he ſits at the right hand of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 31. and from thence doth every drop which diſtills upon the hearts of men deſcend. This is that which <hi>Peter</hi> tells the <hi>Jewes, Act</hi> 2. 33. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt, he hath ſhed forth this which now ye ſee and hear.</hi> All the good of his Word, of his Scepter, of his Spirit, comes down from the Heaven of heavens. There the royal throne is, and from thence doth the raine fall. You muſt look above the higheſt Region of the aire, yea above the higheſt ſtar in the firmament, if you expect any drop from Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The raine that deſcends upon the earth, doth firſt aſcend from the earth.</hi> A cloud which is the womb of the raine, is a cold and moiſt vapour exhaled by the heat of the Sunne, out of the earth or waters, into the middle Region of the aire, where it is by the cold condenſed, and there hangeth, till by the heat it be diſſolved into a ſhower. So that the ſhowers which do drop upon the earth, are firſt drawn out
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:38484:197"/>
of the earth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 135. 7. But now all the drops which diſtil from Chriſt, are generated in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Jeſus Chriſt is not beholden to the earth to furniſh him. What ever he diſtils, either in his Word, or by his Spirit, is originally in and from himſelf. <hi>Out of his fulneſſe have we all received, and grace for grace,</hi> John 1. 16. Chriſt doth not exhale vapours from the earth, but ſends down vapours from himſelf to the earth. All his materials are in himſelf, and from himſelf; if Jeſus Chriſt could not raine upon us till we did furniſh him with materials, we ſhould be out of hopes of receiving one drop from him to the day of our death. We can furniſh him with materials for fire and brimſtone, but the ingredients of his comfortable raine are from himſelf alone.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The raine is not neceſſary at all times.</hi> There are ſeaſons when the husbandman craves no raine. He is ſometimes afraid of ſhowers, and wiſhes for Sun ſhine rather then ſhowers. <hi>As ſnow in Summer and raine in harveſt, ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is not ſeemly for a foole,</hi> Prov. 26. 1. But now Jeſus Chriſt is never unneceſſary. This raine can never faill unſeaſonably. There's no time but the drops of Chriſts doctrine come welcome to the ſoul. There's no moment wherein the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of Chriſts Spirit are not grateful to the ſoule. That day that is not a rainy day, is a mournful day. The earth may be too full of raine, but the ſoule can never be too full of this heavenly moiſture. <hi>Si dixiſti ſufficit, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riisti.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The raine is ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>metimes hurtful to the earth.</hi> Immoderate raine is as prejudicial as immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate drought. <hi>A poor man that oppreſſeth the</hi>

                     </gap> food,</hi> Prov. 28. 3. As parching heat doth ſometimes dry up the fruits of the earth: So exceſſive raine doth often drown the fruits of the earth. Sometimes men and cattel are drowned; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times houſes with their inhabitants are ſwept away by overflowing ſhowers. But now Jeſus Chriſt is never prejudicial to the ſoul. If ever this raine do any annoyance to men, it is by accident, becauſe it is not received or impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. The diſtillation of Chriſts Doctrine is ſometimes the ſavour of death, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 15. but this is onely becauſe men are not bettered by it. The Scepter of Chriſt doth break many in pieces, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 2. 9. but this is becauſe men do not ſubmit to it. The influences and ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings of Chriſt by his Spirit, are ſometimes the occaſion of the hardning of mens hearts, and ſo conſequently of their deſtruction: but this is, becauſe they do reſiſt and oppoſe them. This raine hath intrinſecally no hurtful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive property in it. If it ever prove de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive, it is becauſe of ſome evil quality in them upon whom it falls.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>The raine is no diſtinguiſhing Argument between good and bad.</hi> It falls promiſcuouſly upon the righteous and unrighteous. This our Saviour tells us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 45. The raine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſometimes falls in one place, when it doth not fall on another, <hi>Amos</hi> 4. 7. but on what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever City or Village it falls, it comes down equally on all. As fat drops fall upon the ſluggards field, as upon the field of the moſt diligent man. But now this ſpiritual raine is more diſtinguiſhing. Though all where the Goſpel is preached have the ſame common
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:38484:198"/>
Doctrine, and all have ſome common influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of Chriſts Spirit, yet there are ſpecial drops diſtilled upon the Elect, which others never partake of. Some are hardned, others are ſoftned; ſome are rained upon to conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, others are rained upon for obduration; ſome are melted and diſſolved, others are ſtiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and enraged. The peculiar drops of ſpecial grace are not communicated to all alike from Jeſus Chriſt. Arminians may talk of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal grace, that Chriſt doth no more for <hi>Peter</hi> then for <hi>Judas;</hi> but the Scripture ſpeaks of peculiar grace which is not communicated to all. <hi>Why is it that thou wilt reveal thy ſelf to us, and not unto the world.</hi> John 14. 22. There is hidden Manna which Chriſt never intended to beſtow on all. There are ſecret drops which Chriſt lets fall on one ſoul in a Congregation, and doth not diſtill upon others. This raine falls with a moſt exact diſtinction. <hi>He hath mercy on whom he will have mercy,</hi> (ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <note place="margin">Rev. 2. 17.</note>) <hi>and whom he will he hardeneth,</hi> Rom. 9. 18. Chriſt hath excluded ſome from the benefit of his prayers, <hi>John</hi> 17. 19. And they that are ſhut out of the benefit of his prayers, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the ſaving merit of his blood. His propitiation is not extended further then his mediation, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, 2. The peculiarity of the deſcending of this raine is cleerly ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our Saviour in the anſwer he gives to that queſtion of his Diſciples, concerning his preaching to the people in Parables, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. Though the raine of Chriſts Doctrine fall down indifferently upon all, yet the ſpecial grace of underſtanding, applying and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving that Doctrine, is not given unto all.</p>

6. <hi>The rain can make nothing ſpring where nothing hath rooted.</hi> The ſhowers are able to make both graſſe, and corne, and other plants grow up; but if either the earth be barren, or if there be no foundation of roots, the ſhowers can do nothing; the raine can make nothing grow up out of rocks. It cannot make wheat grow where none was ſowen. But now Jeſus Chriſt doth not onely make ſeed grow where ſeed is ſowen, but he makes ſeed grow where none was ſowen. Chriſt by the drops of his Doctrine, and by the influences of his Spirit, makes the rocks bring forth fruit. He doth not onely cauſe plants to ſpring in good ſoyle, but by the dropping of his grace, turnes a barren ſoyle into a fruitful ſoyle; one good ſhower from Chriſt will make the barren Heath as good ground as the fruitful valley. The Word of Chriſt is called ſeed, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 23. it doth not onely make ſeed grow, but it is ſeed it ſelf. Chriſt by raining down, turnes the Thorne-tree into an Apple-tree. He changes the thiſtle into wheat. Other raine brings up ſomething where ſomething was, but this rain brings up ſomething where nothing was. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhowers bring forth figs from Fig-trees, but theſe ſhowers bring forth figs from thiſtles. Other raine brings up a crop where a crop was ſown, but this raine brings forth a crop where none was ſown. Thoſe three thouſand you reade of <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 37. had not one root in them when <hi>Peter</hi> began to preach; but before he had done raining upon them, their hearts were a nurſery of all living plants.</p>

               <head>The Uſes of this Point.</head>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>How juſtly may Chriſt expect fruitfulneſſe from his people. My beloved</hi> (ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet) <hi>had a vineyard planted in a very fruitful hill. And he fenced it, and gathered out the ſtones, &amp;c. and he looked that it ſhould bring forth grapes,</hi> Eſay 5. 1, 2, 3. It is but equal that they that live under Chriſts Doctrine and Scepter, and under the influences of his Spirit, ſhould bring forth both good fruit, and plenty of fruit; the people of God are compared <hi>to a tree planted by the rivers of water, which bringeth forth his fruit in his ſeaſon,</hi> Pſal. 1. 3. Chriſt is ſpiritual raine, he is both cleanſing raine and fatning raine. They that live under ſuch drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings, will be one day found inexcuſable, if they be not very fruitful; thoſe paſtures that are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nur'd every year, if they have ſeaſonable Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine and ſhowers, are laid open to the wilde champion if they be not fruitful. Remember ſeriouſly that of the Apoſtle, and lay it well to heart, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 7, 8. No Argument can be uſed to plead for thoſe that live under theſe fat ſhowers without abundance of fruit.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Behold the neceſſity of Chriſt.</hi> Is not rain neceſſary for the ground? are not ſeaſonable ſhowers neceſſary for the fields and paſtures? can any plants live long if they be not watered? No more can any plants that are in the ſoul live without continual ſupply from Chriſt. The Doctrine of Chriſt is not unneceſſary, the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Chriſt is not unuſeful, the influences of Chriſts Spirit are not in vaine. Chriſt in all theſe
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:38484:199"/>
reſpects is as neceſſary to the ſoule, as the raine and dew are to the earth. He is either blind, or proud, that doth not ſee an abſolute neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Chriſt. <hi>Egypt</hi> is fruitful though it have no raine; the yearly overflowings of the river <hi>Nilus</hi> is inſtead of ſhowers. Jeſus Chriſt is as the river <hi>Nilus</hi> to our <hi>Egypt:</hi> did not he by the overflowing ſtreams of his grace water our hearts, they would neither bud nor bloſſom, nor bring forth; He is both the husbandman that plants our fruits, he is the ſoyle that beares them, and he alone is the rain that waters them.

at him. The Apoſtle mentions this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 17. 18. They were of opinion that <hi>Tully</hi> and <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> did far excel the Doctrine of Chriſt for eloquence.</p>

               <p n="4">(4) <hi>Others are offended at the Diviſions which follow upon his Doctrine.</hi> Though the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Chriſt be in it ſelf a Doctrine of peace, yet accidentally meeting with the corruptions of wicked hearts, its an occaſion of diviſion, <hi>Luke</hi>

Chriſt hath all the good properties of the raine,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:38484:200"/>
but none of the bad properties. Whoſoever is offended at him, is offended at his own mercy.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Lay your hearts open to receive the diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Christ.</hi> When any of this raine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends, let the veſſels of your ſouls be ſet wide open to receive it. When Chriſt drops in his Doctrine, when Chriſt diſtils upon you by his Spirit; let your hearts be in a readineſſe to drink it in. The raine doth no good unleſs it be taken in. All the drops of Chriſt will do you no good, if you do not take them in. When men are beleaguered in a City and want water, they ſet out all their veſſels, when a ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er comes, that no drop may be loſt. Gods children are in this world as in a beſieged City; you want raine, O let not one drop of Chriſt fall beſides you. Open your mouths wide, that you may take in, yea take down all the pleaſant drops of Chriſt. Two things are neceſſary for thoſe that would have this raine.

If it be ſo ſore a judgement to want the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral raine; what is it to want this ſpiritual raine? Pity ſuch as want Chriſt, more then you pity thoſe that want other raine.</p>

            </list>
            <p n="1">1. For the firſt. Chriſt is called the Corner ſtone in foure reſpects.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In regard of ſuſtentation.</hi> The corner ſtone doth uphold the whole building: if the corner
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:38484:203"/>
of the houſe fall, the whole ſtructure comes to the ground. The Holy Ghoſt ſpeaking of the ſlaughter of <hi>Jobs</hi> children, ſaith, <hi>There came a winde from the Wilderneſſe, and ſmote the foure corners of the houſe, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead,</hi> Job 1. 19. Some ſtones may drop out of the middle of the building, and yet the building may ſtand, but if the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners or foundation ſhrink, the whole fabrick is diſſolved. Jeſus Chriſt is the ſuſteiner and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder of his Church. Therefore he is called the <hi>foundation ſtone,</hi> as well as the <hi>corner ſtone,</hi> Eſay 28. 16. He is the great pillar that beares up his Elect. The Churches peace, the Churches grace, the Churches comfort, the Churches ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation are all upheld and maintained by him. <hi>Solom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n</hi> reared up two pillars of braſs in the Porch of the Temple, the one he called <hi>Jachin,</hi> that is, <hi>he ſhall eſtabliſh;</hi> the other <hi>Boaz,</hi> that is, <hi>ſtrength,</hi> 1 Kin. 7. 21. Theſe two Pillars amongſt other things did typifie the invincible ſtability and ſtrength of the Church, whereof the Temple was a ſign and figure. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt is to his Church, both <hi>Jachin</hi> and <hi>Boaz;</hi> he is both the eſtabliſhment, and the ſtrength of his Elect; he is that golden pillar that beares up all. The Poets have a fictitious conceit of <hi>Atlas</hi> a great Aſtronomer, that he beares up the heaven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his ſhoulders; That's but a fable, the great body of the heaven is a burden inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable to any creature. Jeſus Chriſt is real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the great <hi>Atlas,</hi> that bears the whole bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of the Church with all its concernments upon his ſhoulders. <hi>Eliakim</hi> was in this a type of Chriſt, the Prophet ſaith of him, <hi>Eſay</hi> 22. 21, 22, 13, 24. <hi>that he ſhall be faſtned as a naile</hi>
               <pb n="389" facs="tcp:38484:203"/>
               <hi>in a ſure place, and he ſhall be for a glorious throne to his Fathers houſe; And they ſhall hang upon him all the glory of his Fathers houſe, the off-ſpring and the iſſue, all veſſels of ſmall quantity, from veſſels of cups to all veſſels of flagons.</hi> This <hi>Eliakim</hi> was a figure of Chriſt, for <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 7. that which is here promiſed to him, is attributed to Chriſt; <hi>Theſe things ſaith he that hath the key of David, he that openeth and no man ſhutteth, and he that ſhutteth and no man openeth. He is that golden naile, upon whom all the concernments of the Church both ſmall and great do depend.</hi> From veſſels of cups to veſſels of flagons, all hang upon him. The Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> foretelling his birth, doth attribute this to him, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. 6. When he ſaith, that the <hi>Government ſhall be upon his ſhoulder.</hi> God hath devolved the whole care and weight of his Church upon him, and upon him muſt we roll it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>In regard of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion.</hi> The corner ſtone is that Medium by which the walls of the houſe are united into one building. Pull out the corner ſtones, and the two ſides of the houſe are ſeparated one from the other. Jeſus Chriſt is he and he alone that doth unite the ſeveral ſtones of the ſpiritual building one to another. This may be conſidered two ways.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) <hi>In reference to the uniting of the Jews and Gentiles.</hi> Before Chriſt, the Jew and Gentile were divided and ſeparated one from another. This ſeparation did commence and begin after the return of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> out of <hi>Egypt</hi> into <hi>Canaan,</hi> which place was aſſigned unto them by lot, as we reade in the book of <hi>Joſhuah.</hi> Then were the Jews in a more conſpicuous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner formed into one Polity or Common-wealth,
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:38484:204"/>
and from that time the ſeparation began. That which made this ſeparation was the Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al worſhip which God eſtabliſhed in that Church or Nation, according to which they and their poſterity were to worſhip God. This ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on continued from that time, untill the death and reſurrection of Chriſt. During all this long tract of time, there was a manifeſt ſeparation between the Jew and the Gentile, But now Chriſt hath as a corner ſtone made a firme uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between theſe two, ſo that the Jew and Gentile are brought together under the ſame worſhip. This is done by the abolition of the Ceremonial Law. Chriſt hath taken down this wall of ſeparation, and ſo made both one Church. The Apoſtle treats largely of this, in <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 13, 14, 15, 16. <hi>He is our peace who hath made both one, and broken down the middle wall of partition between us, &amp;c.</hi> The Jew and the Gentile are now made one houſe by the death of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) <hi>In reference to the ſpiritual union of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers one with another.</hi> We reade often in Scripture of ſpiritual fellowſhip and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between beleevers. The Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 1. ſpeaks of <hi>the fellowſhip of the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 5. He makes mention of their <hi>fellowſhip in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</hi> So 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 7. ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>If we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip one with another.</hi> This ſpiritual commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion or fellowſhip doth conſiſt,</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>In mutual affection one to another.</hi> One Saint loves another, though they have never ſeen the faces one of another.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>In participation of the ſame graces and priviledges.</hi> They are all like one another:
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:38484:204"/>
They partake of the ſame gifts, of the ſame Graces; the ſame Reconciliation, the ſame Adoption, the ſame Sanctification; the ſame Salvation that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to one, belongs to them al. This is that which the Apoſtle mentions, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 4 5, 6. From hence it is that the Scripture calls the ſalvation of the Elect, <hi>Common-ſalvation, Jude</hi> 3. becauſe it's common to all the Elect. The ſame graces which are wrought in one Saint, are wrought in another, though perhaps different in degree.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>In the performing of mutual offices one to another.</hi> They pray one for another, they give thanks for the good of one another, they grieve for one anothers evils, they beare one anothers burthens, they rejoyce in one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others comforts, they ſupply one anothers wants, both outward and inward as far as they are able. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of theſe mutual of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, which beleevers by vertue of that fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which is between them owe one to another, in that, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 26 Now it is in and through Chriſt, that union and communion of Saints one with another is made. Our communion with Chriſt is the foundation of our mutual commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which we have one with another, <hi>John</hi> 17. 23. I <hi>in them and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one.</hi> 'Tis this uniting corner ſtone that brings every particular ſtone of the building into one. For our mutual union one with another, is in him who is the head of the union. The Apoſtle ſpeaks fully to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, in <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>That he might gather together in him all things, both which are in heaven, and which are in earth.</hi> The Greek word is very ſignificant, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>to gather to a head.</hi> All the Saints of God that are, were, or ſhall be, both
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:38484:205"/>
thoſe that are gloriouſly triumphing in heaven, and thoſe that are yet militant on earth, are gathered together to a head in Jeſus Chriſt. Memberſhip with him is the foundation of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual memberſhip which we have one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This is the ſecond.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>In regard of Direction.</hi> The corner ſtone is that which gives the builders direction, how to lay and place all the other ſtones. If the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſtones of the wall be not laid level to the corner ſtone, the whole building is ſpoiled. He that would build right, muſt have his eye to the corner ſtone. Jeſus Chriſt is a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers Direction and Rule in all ſpiritual things, that which is not done by Chriſts Command, or example or by ſome direction from him, is not wel done. <hi>Learne of me</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>for I am lowly, and meek-hearted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ye ſhall finde reſt to your ſouls,</hi> Mat. 11. 29. Jeſus Chriſt is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers pattern. His Word and his example we muſt have an eye continually upon, if we would not miſcarry. <hi>He that ſaith he abideth in Chriſt, he ought ſo to walk as he walked.</hi> 1 John 2. 6. Lay all things level to Chriſt, and then act vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly. <hi>I have given you an example, that ye ſhould do as I have done to you,</hi> John 13. 15. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will either be laſting or comfortable, which doth not runne parallel with the line of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>In regard of Beauty.</hi> Skilful builders place the ſtrongeſt ſtones in the corner, becauſe of bearing; and the faireſt ſtones, becauſe of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. If the corner ſtones be graceful, the whole building is the more comely, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144. 12.

He is in reſpect of his beauty compared to the Lily and Roſe, which are the moſt beautiful of all flowers, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 1. The blinde world looked upon him as deformed, <hi>Eſay</hi> 53. 2. There is no forme nor comelineſſe in him, but thoſe that know him, admire his beauty. Look upon him in his Divine Nature, and ſo he is more beautiful then the Sunne. Look upon him as man; and ſo he is exceeding beautiful. No doubt but his body, for the outward feature of it was very comely. 'Tis a Rule which Divines have. That which God doth <hi>immediately,</hi> he doth moſt <hi>exactly.</hi> And for his ſoule, that had more grace in it then is in all the ſons of men laid together. His ſoul was unſoyl'd by ſinne, and it was rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly furniſhed with all grace. God ſhewed more of his Art and skill in Ieſus Chriſt, then upon all the ſtones of the building beſides. The beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Angels are black, if compared with Chriſt. This is the firſt particular.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For the ſecond. Chriſt differs from all other corner ſtones in five reſpects.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>He is a living stone.</hi> The corner ſtones of all material buildings are inanimate. But Chriſt hath life in him, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>He hath life in himſelf,</hi> and he communicates life unto the whole build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. From him all the ſtones of the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual houſe are called <hi>lively ſtones,</hi> ver. 5. Ye alſo as lively ſtones are built up a ſpiritual houſe.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="394" facs="tcp:38484:206"/>
2. <hi>He is a ſtone of Gods immediate laying.</hi> God himſelf did both poliſh and place this ſtone. Other corner ſtones are faſhioned and laid by men, but this is faſhioned by God himſelfe. This is in the Text, <hi>Behold I lay in Sion a chief corner ſtone.</hi> He is therefore called by the Prophet, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 34. <hi>A stone cut out of the mountaine without hands;</hi> that is, without the hands of men. There was no humane help for the poliſhing of this ſtone, God himſelf is the chiefe and onely Architect.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>He is a Corner ſtone that can never drop out of the building.</hi> Other corner ſtones will in time looſen and fall: the corner ſtones of that Temple did at laſt fall, but this corner ſtone can neither fall, nor be weakned. Chriſt ſticks as faſt now, as he did the firſt day he was placed.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>He receives no ſtrength from the other ſtones.</hi> All material corner ſtones, as they ſtrengthen the building, ſo they receive ſtrength from the building. The other ſtones are ſome defence to the corner ſtone: but Chriſt receives no ſtrengthening from any ſtone of the building. What need hath Chriſt of ſupport? If he had, what can weak Saints do to ſupport him? The Saints help to ſtrengthen one another, they contribute no ſtrengthening at all to him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Chriſt is a Corner stone that reaches from the bottome to the top.</hi> In other buildings there are many corner ſtones, becauſe no one is large enough to ſerve for all: But Chriſt is ſo large that there is no need of any other. The building is a carrying on every day, and will be, till all the number of the Elect
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:38484:206"/>
be brought in: but let it riſe never ſo high there will not need one corner ſtone more. If there were but one corner ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="1">1. <hi>The perpetssity of the Church.</hi> The Church of Chriſt is a ſtable build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; it may ſhake, and totter, and be ready to fall, but it cannot utterly fall. The Church of God may erre both in Doctrine and manners. The beſt of men are but enlightned and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified in part, there is a remainder of blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ignorance in their minde, and of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion and ſtubborneſſe in their wills and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, therefore they may erre both in Doctrine and manners. The Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> is char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by our Saviour, that ſhe had <hi>left her first love,</hi> Rev. 2. 4. <hi>The Church of Galatia is</hi> ſaid to be <hi>removed to another Goſpel;</hi> And that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fals <note place="margin">Chap. 1. 6.</note> one or two Churches, may befal an hundred Churches. Our Divines prove againſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, that general Councels have erred. The
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:38484:207"/>
Church of God may ſometimes he hid under perſecution, it may want the publick preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word, with the publick Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacraments. Our Divines prove a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Papiſts that the Church of God is not alwayes ſo apparently viſible as they would have it. In the dayes of the Prophet <hi>Elijah,</hi> the Church of God was under a great eclipſe. See what he ſaith, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19. 10. <hi>The children of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael have forſaken thy Covenant, &amp;c.</hi> The Church was very low, when ſo intelligent a Prophet could not finde one beſides himſelf that cleaved to God, yet what anſwer doth God give him <hi>v.</hi> 18? <hi>Yet have I left me ſeven thouſand in Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, all the knees that have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth which hath not kiſſed him.</hi> Hear what the Prophet <hi>Azariah</hi> ſaith to King <hi>Aſa</hi> to this very purpoſe, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 3. For a long ſeaſon <hi>Iſrael hath been without the true God, and without a teaching Prieſt, and without Law.</hi> As the Sunne and Moon do not alwayes viſibly ſhine out to the world, but ſometimes ſuffer an eclipſe, ſo doth the Church of God; yet nevertheleſſe the Church of God can never be utterly exterminated. If we conſider the <hi>nature of the thing,</hi> the Church may be aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ceaſe to have a being in the earth; but if we conſider the <hi>Decree of God,</hi> ſo the Church can never ceaſe. God ever had ſince the promiſe made to <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe, a Church in the world, and he ever will have a Church in the earth, till all the members thereof be made triumphant in heaven. <hi>The gates of hell ſhall never prevaile againſt it,</hi> Mat. 16. 18. It may be brought low, but it cannot be thrown down. Theſe material fabricks,
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:38484:208"/>
where the Church of God meet for holy wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, may be thorough the fury and covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of men be taken down, that one ſtone ſhall not be left upon another. See how the Church complains of the havock made by thoſe Sacrilegious invaders, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74. 7, 8. The Church was not deſtroyed, though the Temple and Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues were deſtroyed. This ſpiritual build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Church ſhall ſtand, though all other ſtructures fall. The great reaſon is, becauſe Chriſt is the foundation and corner ſtone. Other buildings may fall though the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſtand; but this building cannot fall, unleſſe the foundation be deſtroyed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That the Church of God is a very glorious building.</hi> Amongſt many other titles which are given to the Church, this is one; it's called <hi>a glorious Church,</hi> Eph. 5. 27. It ſhall be glorious when it comes to heaven, of which that Text is properly to be underſtood; And it is glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous even here on earth. <hi>I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jeruſalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon,</hi> Cant. 1. 5. <hi>A glorious and high throne from the beginning is the place of our Sanctuary,</hi> Jer. 17. 12. All the Edifices and Palaces on earth, are but ugly cottages, it they be compared with this ſpiritual building, the Church. The Temple of <hi>Solomon</hi> was the moſt excellent fabrick that ever the earth carried, <hi>Its called a glorious and beautiful houſe,</hi> Iſa. 64. 11. and yet that was but a type of this building. See how it is deſcribed in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> chap. 21. 10, 11, &amp;c. It muſt needs be glorious, becauſe all the ſtones are <hi>living ſtones.</hi> Every ſtone hath the glory of God on it, and then beſides, which makes it beautiful indeed, Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

               </gap> muſt that building be, where Chriſt himſelf lies as the foundation ſtone! To be the leaſt ſtone in this building, is far better, then to be the greateſt pillar of any material building.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The Beleevers union with Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The Scripture doth frequently tell us the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the ſpiritual union of Chriſt and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers. They are not onely one by participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of gifts and graces; they are not onely one in will and affection, as the members of the Primitive Church are ſaid to be, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 32. but there is a real ſpiritual union between them. <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>in them, and thou in me,</hi> John 17. 23. This Priviledge is proved, as by other expreſſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, ſo by this Metaphor; As the corner ſtone, and the ſuperſtructories are united in one building; ſo Chriſt the corner ſtone, and all the living ſtones built upon him are made one myſtical houſe. The Apoſtle mentioneth this from this very ſimilitude, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 20, 21. Chriſt and beleevers are made one holy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; onely there is this difference between that union, which is between Chriſt the corner ſtone and the living ſtones, and the corner ſtone and ſuperſtructory ſtones of material buildings: Every beleever is as neerly united to Chriſt as any beleever. In other buildings ſome ſtones are more neerly united to the foundation then others are; but in this building every Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever is equally united to Chriſt the corner ſtone.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The horrible pride of the Papiſts.</hi> They are ſo intollerably proud, as to apply this Title to the <hi>Pope,</hi> making him the corner ſtone of the Church. They apply that in <hi>Eſay</hi> 28. 16. to
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:38484:209"/>
the perſon of the Pope, as if he were the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Univerſal viſible Church. They ſay that the Pope is in the Church as the Sun is in the firmament, and that the ruining and ſhaking of the Pope, would be the ſhaking and ruining of the whole Church. The Scripture teaches us a better foundation. Both Prophets and Apoſtles were ignorant of this Romiſh foundation; they built not on the Pope, but on Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 20. The Pope is the corner ſtone of the <hi>Apoſtatical</hi> Church, not of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical</hi> Church, He is the foundation ſtone of the <hi>adulterate</hi> Church, not of the <hi>chaſt</hi> Church; he is the foundation of the <hi>Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue of Satan,</hi> not of the <hi>Spou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e of Chriſt.</hi> The Church would be ſure to fall, if it had ſo weak and ſo wicked a foundation as that <hi>man of ſinne is</hi> Chriſt did not ſay, upon thee <hi>Peter, but upon this rock will I build my Church,</hi> Mat. 16. 18. <hi>Peter,</hi> whoſe ſucceſſor the Pope boaſts himſelf to be, did publickly preach Chriſt, not himſelf the corner ſtone, <hi>Acts</hi> 4 11. It is no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, but a great diſgrace to be a ſtone of that building, whoſe foundation ſtone is the ſon of perdition.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Behold from this Text the truth of the two natures of Chriſt.</hi> The Scriptures teach that Jeſus Chriſt is both God and man. Both theſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are aſſerted in this Text. The Divinity is confirmed from the cloſe of the verſe, <hi>He that beleeveth on him ſhall not be confounded.</hi> If Chriſt were not God, it were idolatry to beleeve on him. No meer creature is without ſin, to be relied upon without ſin. And then the truth of his humanity appeares from hence, that he is the corner ſtone of the ſpiritual building. He could
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:38484:209"/>
not be a part of the ſpiritual houſe, if he were not of the ſame nature with the other ſtones of the building, ſo often as you read faith in Chriſt required, beleeve his God-head, and as often as ye heare him called the corner ſtone of the Church; beleeve the truth of his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>The greatneſſe of Chriſts ſtrength.</hi> The Scripture doth attribute Almighty power to Chriſt as well as to the Father. His name <hi>ſhall be called the mighty God,</hi> Eſay 9. 6. The ſtrength of Chriſt appears by the great works he hath done and doth do. He ſet up the world by his power, <hi>Without him was not made any thing that was made.</hi> John 1. 3. He doth by his power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful providence govern the world; Providence belongs to Chriſt as well as to the Father; <hi>My Father worketh hitherto, and I work,</hi> John 5. 17. And then his power appears in this, that he is the chief corner ſtone that upholds the Church; if there were not Almighty power in him, ſuch a burden would break him to pieces. Next to the bearing of his Fathers wrath; no ſuch hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy burden, as the ſuſteining of all the concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Church. Conſider what a vaſt fabrick the Church is, it's a very huge building. And then conſider what potent enemies it hath, a world of wicked men, legions of powerful Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; and then conſider how weak every ſtone is in it ſelf. And then conſider the multitude of its concernments, and it will appear, that he that bears up this building, muſt needs be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of vaſt and infinite ſtrength. <hi>Thou hast laid ſtrength</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>on one that is mighty,</hi> Pſ. 89. 17.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>The nearneſſe of Chriſt to his Church.</hi> The
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:38484:210"/>
Name of the Lord is called <hi>Jehovah Shammah, Ezek. ult. ult.</hi> Chriſt hath promiſed to be with it for ever, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. <hi>ult.</hi> He ſeemes ſometimes to be far off, to try how his people will carry themſelves in his abſence; the nature and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity of the childe is beſt ſeen in his Fathers abſence. But though he ſeem to be at a diſtance, yet he is neere; he may be out of their ſight, but he is never out of their call; <hi>The Lord is neer to all them that call upon him.</hi> This Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor ſheweth this, the corner ſtone is not farre off from the roof, and yet Chriſt is neerer to his people, then the corner ſtone is to the next ſtone of the building. He is not onely with them, but in them, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 23. Thus much for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For Exhortation. It commends theſe four things to all us Chriſtians.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Take heed of building upon any other founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> The Evangeliſt makes mention of a double foundation, which our Saviour ſpeaks of at the cloſe of his Sermon on the Mount, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 24. 26. <hi>The rocky foundation</hi> is onely one, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Jeſus Chriſt, or which is all one, faith in Chriſt. <hi>The ſandy foundation</hi> is manifold.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Some build their hopes of ſalvation on their good works.</hi> This is the foundation of the Papiſts. They hope to be ſaved by their doing. They may do well to conſider what the Scripture ſaith of this foundation, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 10. And <hi>Romans</hi> 9. 30, 31, 32, 33. building on works is not a divine, but a humane foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Some build upon outward profeſſion.</hi> This is the foundation of carnal profeſſours. They may do
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:38484:210"/>
well to conſider what our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 26, 27.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Some build upon their good meanings.</hi> They have as good a heart to God as the beſt. This is the foundation of ignorant Proteſtants. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever foundation of ſalvation, grace or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, beſides Chriſt, is laid, is a ſandy foundation, and will appear to be ſo at the day of judgement. The Apoſtle cuts off all other foundations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 11. He did not ſpeak igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly, for he ſaith, <hi>v.</hi> 10. that he was a wiſe Maſter-builder. They are not wiſe Maſter-build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but ignorant botchers that build, or teach others to build, either hope of comfort, or of ſalvation upon any other foundation. In one word, all foundations of ſalvation beſides Chriſt, how ſpacious ſoever they be, will prove at laſt foundations of damnation, Arminian, Socinian, Popiſh corner-ſtones will moulder.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Acknowledge upon whom all your ſpiritual good doth depend.</hi> All your graces, all your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, all your priviledges are bottom'd on Chriſt.

            <p>For the firſt, <hi>Elect.</hi> This word hath a double ſignification. It ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies <hi>choice, excellent.</hi> And it ſignifies <hi>elected,</hi> or <hi>choſen. Gerhard</hi> thinks <gap reason="foreign">

But I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conceive that it is here uſed participially, for elected or choſen. This ſignification have our Tranſlators given it. I am induced to think it is ſo uſed here for two reaſons.</p>

<pb n="407" facs="tcp:38484:212"/>
of what is there ſaid. It refers to the act of God in chuſing Chriſt for the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſtone of the Church. The point is this.</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>That Ieſus Chriſt is choſen by God for the corner ſtone or foundation of the Church.</hi> God the Father hath elected him for this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
            <p>Here are two things to be opened.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. What this election hath reference to.</item>
               <item>2. Why Chriſt was thus elected.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. For the former. This election referres to foure of acts God concerning Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>To his eternal deſignation</hi> of Chriſt to this work. The everlaſting determination of God was, that Chriſt ſhould perform this office in and for his Church. Of this our Apoſtle ſpeaks, in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 20. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>To his publick miſſion.</hi> As he was foreor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined before all time, ſo he was publickly ſent in the fulneſſe of time, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4, 5. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture often mentions the miſſion of Chriſt, <hi>Eſay</hi> 61. 1. <hi>he hath ſent me, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>To the divine unction.</hi> God hath anointed the humane nature, filled it with all grace and with abundance of grace for this work. The Prophet ſpeaks of this unction, <hi>Eſay</hi> 61. 1. and more fully, <hi>Eſay</hi> 11. 2, 3, 4. This is that which our Saviour calls, Gods <hi>ſealing of him,</hi> John 6. 27. This ſealing refers to two things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>the ſolemne appointment of God.</hi> God hath authorized him publickly under his broad ſeale for this work.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>God hath furniſhed him for the work, by communicating to him the fulneſſe, the unmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable</hi>
               <pb n="408" facs="tcp:38484:213"/>
               <hi>fulneſſe of his Spirit.</hi> For the Spirit is not given to him by <hi>meaſure,</hi> John 3. 34.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To the publick teſtimony given by God to Chriſt. God hath given very ſolemn Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and approbation to Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="1">(1) By audible voices from heaven, once at his baptiſme, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 17. A ſecond time at his tranfiguration, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 5.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) By ſerious recommendation of him in the Goſpel to men, that they ſhould rely upon him. The Evangeliſt makes mention of this 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 10, 11.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For the latter. The great moving cauſe is, his meer mercy to his Elect. No other was able, Chriſt was ſufficient to diſcharge this great work. Out of his rich love did God chuſe him, upon this hinge all turns, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 16.</p>
            <p>But if the reaſons be demanded why Chriſt ſhould have ſuch ſolemne election, &amp;c. Theſe may be conſidered.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The offices which Chriſt undertook,</hi> did call for this divine Election; he was to be Prophet, Prieſt, King, fit therefore it was that he ſhould be thus ſolemnly ſet out. Prophets muſt be ſent, elſe they are none of Gods, <hi>Ier.</hi> 23. 21. Chriſt was a Prophet, therfore he would have a formal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rization from him whoſe Prophet he was, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. 18. Chriſt was a King <hi>Pſalme</hi> 2. 6. Therefore fit he ſhould be ſufficiently authorized, hence is that, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 110. 1. Chriſt was a Prieſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he muſt be lawfully conſecrated, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 4, 5, 6. <hi>no man taketh this honour, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Elſe that which Chriſt did would not have been accepted of God, nor would it have been meritorious for his Church. It would have been ſacriledge for Chriſt to have made himſelfe a
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:38484:213"/>
corner ſtone, if God had not choſen him for the work. <hi>This is my well beloved Sonne in whom I am well pleaſed,</hi> Matth. 3. 17. God would not have been well pleaſed with Chriſt, if he had not elected him for the work he undertook. And then</p>
            <p n="3">3. For the comforting of Chriſt, in undergoing that which he was to ſuffer for the carrying on of this work. He muſt endure the wrath of God, the contradiction of ſinners, before he could be the corner ſtone. Divine appointment comforts a man in the hardeſt ſorrows, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. 9. Thou ſaidſt, return to thy country. The conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of this, ſtrengthned and comforted Chriſt in all he ſuffered, <hi>John</hi> 18. 11.</p>
            <div type="uses">
               <head>The Uſes of this.</head>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Father and holy Ghoſt have a hand in the work</hi> of mans ſalvation, as well as Chriſt, we ſcarce take notice of the Father in the work of redemption, as if he only did look on and approve what Chriſt did, he acts in it as well as Chriſt; he choſe Chriſt, he ſent out Chriſt, he fitted Chriſt for this great work. Though the ſecond perſon was he that was incarnate, yet both the firſt and third perſon concurre and contribute to the work. The divine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection is the firſt wheele that moves in this work.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That the work of our ſalvation by Chriſt, is not a raſh work.</hi> 'Tis not a work of inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, or precipitancy, but a ſerious work. There was much deliberation, and conſultation about it. Here is mention of electing Chriſt.
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:38484:214"/>
It's a work of infinite and unſearchable wiſdom. The myſtery of godlineſſe the Apoſtle calls it, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>The manifold wiſdom of God,</hi> Epheſ. 3. 10. here is depth of wiſdome in this work.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That the Elects ſalvation by Chriſt is a work well pleaſing to God.</hi> It's called the <hi>pleaſure of the Lord,</hi> Eſay 53. 10. It is a great contentment to God to ſee it carried on; it cannot be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, when he himſelf hath elected Chriſt to it. That which a man chuſeth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trives, he is pleaſed when it is carried on. God that hath choſen Chriſt for the foundation, will carry on the work in his hand.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Why Chriſt is called Gods Elect and Gods Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> Eſay 42. 1, 2. not as if he were inferior to God in regard of his divine nature, <hi>Zech.</hi> 13. 13. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 6. but becauſe he is <hi>choſen of God</hi> to be the foundation; He is choſen to be the head of the Election, all the Elect are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Let us with confidence caſt our ſelves on Chriſt. Can we chuſe better then God hath choſen? 'Tis an undervaluing, not onely of Gods love, but of his wiſdom to chuſe another foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. God will take it ill if we reject his choice. Adventure on him you may. Believe and truſt in him without doubting. He that hath elected Chriſt, will not reject thoſe that accept and relie on Chriſt. The Election of God will mightily aggravate the refuſal of Chriſt. Encourage faith by this, <hi>He that beleeveth in him ſhall not be aſhamed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Very great comfort to them that have
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:38484:214"/>
built on Chriſt. God doth not chuſe mouldring ſtones, but firme ſtones. If God have any wiſdome to chuſe, Chriſt is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to beare all their weight. <hi>He hath laid help on one that is mighty,</hi> Pſalme 89. 19. Let what blaſts will come, this Elect ſtone will hold.</p>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, precious. The word here uſed <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, ſignifies that which is of great worth or value in it ſelfe, and that which is much prized and eſteemed by another. A thing and a perſon may be valuable in it ſelf, and not valued by others. And then a thing may be highly in it ſelf eſteemed, which is of no great worth; but this word ſignifies both, That it denotes the worth of things or perſons, you may ſee, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 8. <hi>When thou art bidden to a wedding, ſit not down in the higheſt room, leſt a more honourable man then then be bidden of him,</hi>

            <p>Doct. <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt the chief corner ſtone of the Church is exceeding precious.</hi> As he is a ſtone of Gods chuſing, ſo he is a choice ſtone.

               <item>2. Why he is ſo meanly eſteemed by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of men.</item>

            <p n="2">1. <hi>He is precious in the account of God.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt is the delight both of the Father and of the holy Ghoſt. God values him as a pearl of great price.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="413" facs="tcp:38484:215"/>
(1) He is in Scripture called the Son of his boſome. The onely begotten Sonne who is in the <hi>boſome of his Father,</hi> John 1. 18. As men and women ſhew their eſteeme of jewels and pearls by wearing them at their boſome, ſo doth God teſtifie his high eſteem of Chriſt by laying him in his boſome. The Sonne of God never was, never will be out of the boſome of the Father.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) The publick teſtimony which God gave from heaven to Jeſus Chriſt at his baptiſme, is an evidence of the high eſteeme he hath of him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>This is my well beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">(3) <hi>He is ſo precious in Gods account,</hi> that the Father will accept of none but through him, nor will he reject any, whom he recommends to him.</p>
            <p n="4">(4) <hi>The great deſigne of God in the Goſpel is to put honour upon Chriſt.</hi> He commands all men <hi>to honour the Sonne as they honour the Father.</hi> All the good he beſtows upon men is in Chriſt and through Chriſt alone.</p>
            <p n="5">(5) <hi>The Father would never have put ſuch a truſt into his hands, as the redeeming and ſaving of the Elect, if he had not been of precious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in his ſight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">(6) <hi>His preſent ſeſſion at Gods right hand in heaven,</hi> is a full and manifeſt proof how dear he is to him. God hath ſet him there as a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the higheſt account of him, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 22.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>He is precious in the eſteeme of the Angels.</hi> The Angelical hoſt did him honour at his birth, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 13, 14. They tuned their inſtruments and ſang with a loud voice, <hi>Glory be to God in</hi>
               <pb n="414" facs="tcp:38484:216"/>
               <hi>the higheſt.</hi> As God hath commanded them to worſhip him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 6. ſo they do continually worſhip him. They are ready at his beck to do his will. They <hi>do aſcend and deſcend upon the Son of man,</hi> John 1. 51. Not as if they miniſtred to Chriſt alone, but becauſe out of reſpect to Chriſt, and to do him honour, they do at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand go forth to ſerve his Church as he gives them charge. The Angels worſhip the Sonne with the very ſame aderation wherewith they worſhip the Father. Chriſt is very high in their books.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>He is precious in the eſteeme of the Saints.</hi> Whether ye take it of the Saints <hi>triumphant,</hi> or of the Saints <hi>militant;</hi> for the Saints triumphant, ſee how they adore him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 8, 9. And the Saints militant, they have an high eſteeme of him. They glory and triumph in him. They venture their whole ſalvation upon him. They diſeſteeme all other things in reſpect of him. <hi>I account all things</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>but loſſe for the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus my Lord,</hi> Phil. 3. 7, 8. They are joyful when they can have communion with him. See what follows in the verſe after the Text, <hi>unto you that beleeve he is precious;</hi> he is but a nominal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever that doth not account Chriſt precious. See how the Church ſpeaks of him, <hi>Cantiles</hi> 5. 10. <hi>He is white and ruddy, the chiefeſt of ten thouſands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>He is precious in himſelf.</hi> This I ſhall ſhew you in theſe three particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In the glory of his perſon.</hi> Never did ſuch a perſon appear in the world as is Jeſus Chriſt. He is truly God, and truly and properly man. The Divine and humane Nature never hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatically
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:38484:216"/>
met in any perſon, beſides the perſon of Chriſt. The Apoſtle ſaith of him; that he <hi>is the brightneſſe of his Fathers glory,</hi> and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe image of his perſon, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>He is the head of principalities and powers,</hi> Col. 2. 10. The higheſt and moſt glorious of the Angels being compared to Chriſt, is but a dark and a fullied creature. He excels the Angels in the glory of his perſon, far more then they do the meaneſt of men. All the Divine attributes are appropriated to Chriſt as he is the Son of God, as well as to the Father. He is eternal, <hi>Micah</hi> 5. 2. <hi>His goings forth are from everlaſting.</hi> He is immutable as the Father is; <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 12. He is omniſcient, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 13. He is omnipotent, <hi>Eſay</hi> 9. 6. In one word, he is as God every way e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to the Father, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 6. There are ſuch myſteries in the perſon of Chriſt, as ſhall be matter of admiration both to men and Angels to all eternity. There is in Chriſt <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, though not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, identity of perſon, and diverſity of natures, and theſe united with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out compoſition and confuſion, both natures reteining their diſtinct properties, and yet both making but one perſon. This is the firſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>In the glory of his qualifications and endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt is endued with ſuch rare gifts and graces as never any before. See how the Scripture expreſſeth it, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 45. 7. <hi>God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thy God hath anointed thee with oyle of glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe above thy fellows,</hi> Col. 2. 3. <hi>In him are hid all the treaſures of wiſdom and knowledge,</hi> Col. 1. 19. <hi>It plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Father, that in him all fulneſſe ſhould dwell.</hi> The fulneſſe of grace in Chriſt excels the fulneſſe of all other perſons in theſe three reſpects.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In him are all kindes of fulneſſe.</hi> He hath not
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:38484:217"/>
onely the fulneſſe of parts, but the fulneſſe of degrees alſo. The beſt of the Saints have onely the fulneſſe of parts. There may be additions made to their fulneſſe. But in Chriſt is fulneſſe of degrees. There can be no additions made to his fulneſſe. The Spirit which is given to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in meaſure, is given to Chriſt without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, <hi>John</hi> 3. 34. And then</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>In Chriſt there is the fulneſſe of redundancy as well as the fulneſſe of ſufficiency.</hi> All other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have onely a fulneſſe of ſufficiency. The Angels albeit they want nothing which is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their eſtate, yet they have no overplus to redound to others. But now in Chriſt is the fulneſſe of redundance; he hath not onely the fulneſſe of the veſſel as others have, but he hath the fulneſſe of the fountaine, whereby he is able to communicate unto others, <hi>Zech.</hi> 13. 1. <hi>A fountaine ſhall be ſet open for ſin and for unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> He hath the fulneſſe of the root, the fulneſſe of the heap, the fulneſſe of the Sunne. Hence it is that men are invited to him, to be made partakers of his fulneſſe, <hi>Eſay</hi> 55. 1. All the fulneſſe that is in the Saints, is communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from him to them, according to that of the Evangeliſt, <hi>John</hi> 1. 16. <hi>Of his fulneſſe have we all received, and grace for grace.</hi>

That fulneſſe which is in the Saints, is the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a diſh, which is abated, if one drop be taken away; but the fulneſſe of Chriſt is as the fulneſſe of the fire, which though it kindle hundreds of ſticks, yet is not abated; or as the fulneſſe of the Sunne, which though it ſend down its beames continually upon the world, yet the light of it is not darkned. Never any perſon endowed with ſo many excellencies in ſuch a meaſure after ſuch a manner as Jeſus Chriſt. No perfection can be named or imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, which is not to be found tranſcendently in Jeſus Chriſt; wiſdome, beauty, meekneſſe, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, heavenlineſſe, &amp;c.

The ſufferings of Chriſt are ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, that if ten thouſand worlds were, there would be redundancy of merit in Chriſt to ſave them all. This is the third.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For the ſecond. Chriſt is ſo meanly eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of by men, of the greateſt part of men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of three things, <hi>viz.</hi> Ignorance, Pride, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>They are ignorant of him.</hi> The greateſt part of the world is quite blinde in ſpiritual things, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. As in other ſpiritual things, ſo in this of the worth of Chriſt. A blinde man can ſee no more excellency in a precious ſtone then in a common ſtone. A blinde Chriſtian can ſee no more worth in Chriſt, then in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſon. This you may ſee from that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, which is propounded by the daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Cant. 5. 9. <hi>What is thy beloved more then another beloved, O thou faireſt among women? &amp;c.</hi> Their very queſtion bewrays their ignorance; had they known any thing of him, they would not have ſaid, <hi>What is thy beloved?</hi>
               <pb n="419" facs="tcp:38484:218"/>
The wiſdome of the Goſpel, whereby Jeſus Chriſt is made known, is hidden wiſdom, <hi>'Tis wiſdom in a myſtery,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 7, 8. which none can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand but thoſe that are ſavingly enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This ignorance of Chriſt under which the greateſt part of men are held, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth</p>
            <p n="1">(1) Partly, <hi>from the negligence and ſlothfulneſſe that is in men.</hi> They are idle and will not take paines to ſtudy the Word of God, which ſets out Chriſt. They caſt the Scriptures from them. Our Saviour ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 5. 39. <hi>That the Scriptures teſtifie of him;</hi> men do not ſearch this bleſſed book as they ſhould; either they read not at all, or elſe they reade ſuperficially; they do not pray that God would diſcover Chriſt to them in and by the Word. Hence they are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of him.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) Partly, <hi>from their Atheiſtical unbelief of what they heare reported by others.</hi> Though they cannot but hear ſometimes the reports of Chriſt in the publick Miniſtry, yet they will give no aſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nt of faith to them, but oppoſe and reject them as the fancies of men. This is that which the Prophet alledgeth, <hi>Eſay</hi> 53. 1. <hi>Who hath beleeved our report, and to whom is the arme of the Lord revealed? Ex iis qui Evangelicum audiunt vix centeſimum quemque fidelem fore,</hi> ſaith <hi>Calvin</hi> upon the place. Scarce the hundreth part of thoſe that heare the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel do yeild a cordial aſſent to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</p>
            <p n="3">(3) Partly, <hi>from a judiciary hand of God upon them.</hi> God uſually puniſheth voluntary blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with a penal and judiciary blindneſſe. This
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:38484:219"/>
is that which the Prophet is taught of God, <hi>Eſay</hi> 6. <hi>ult.</hi> Go and preach to this people, ſaying, <hi>Seeing, ye ſhall ſee, and not perceive; and hearing, ye ſhall heare, and not underſtand, &amp;c.</hi> The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle makes application of this Text, to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeving Jewes, who would not receive what he had with ſo much clearneſſe proved concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Jeſus Chriſt, both out of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and out of the Prophets, <hi>Acts</hi> 28. 23, 24, 25, 26. When men that live under the Goſpel ſhut their own eyes, God doth ratifie it by an act of his juſtice, and ſaith, Be thou blinded for ever. When a man hardens his own heart, God is pleaſed to ratifie it in heaven, and ſaith, Let that heart never be ſoftned. See that of our Saviour to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>John</hi> 12. 37, &amp;c. Now becauſe men neglect the ſtudy of the Goſpel which ſhewes what Chriſt is, becauſe they refuſe to aſſent to, and cloſe with what the Miniſters of God report out of the Goſpel concerning Chriſt, becauſe God puniſheth the voluntary blinding their eyes, with a judicial blinding, therefore do they remaine ignorant of the preciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt. And becauſe they are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of him, therefore they diſeſteeme him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Their pride.</hi> The greateſt part of men, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of thoſe that live under the Goſpel, are puft up with arrogancy and ſelf-conceit. They dreame that they are in ſo good a condition al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready that Chriſt cannot make them better. They are ful of vaine confidences; ſome fleſhly boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or other they have in their hearts; ſome carnal City of refuge they erect for themſelves beſides Chriſt, and this makes Chriſt leſſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious

            <p n="1">1. <hi>The exceeding great glory of the Church of Christ.</hi> The Scripture tells us that the Church of God is a glorious body. Though the Church (taken in its more large acception, as it contains all viſible profeſſors) be in many reſpects leſſe glorious, becauſe o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. It's glorious as in regard of the holineſſe of the members, ſo chiefly in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of Chriſt the glorious foundation. A houſe whoſe corners are laid with precious
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:38484:221"/>
ſtones, and whoſe ſuperſtructory ſtones are all lively ſtones, muſt needs be glorious. Never ſuch a building in the world as the Church of God is. See how the Evangelical Prophet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes it, <hi>Eſay</hi> 54. 11. <hi>O you afflicted, toſſed with tempeſts and not comforted, behold I will lay thy ſtones with faire colours, and lay thy foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation with Saphires, &amp;c.</hi> 'Tis much like that deſcription which is made of it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 10, 11, 12 &amp;c. Every thing which is in the Church makes for the glory of it. Glorious in its mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, who are cloathed with the glory of God; glorious in regard of the worſhip which is there uſed, and of the Ordinances there diſpenſed, in regard of the Doctrine there there main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. <hi>Calvin</hi> I remember, underſtands by thoſe precious ſtones mentioned, <hi>Eſay</hi> 54. 11, 12. The variety of the gifts and graces of God to his people. <hi>Paul</hi> underſtands by the ſame precious ſtones the doctrine taught in the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 11. The Church is glorious, both in reſpect of the doctrine, and of the various gifts and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God diſpenſed amongſt the members of it. But the great glory of all lies in the foundation-ſtone, Jeſus Chriſt. That muſt needs be a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous building, which hath its foundation on ſuch a precious ſtone as Jeſus Chriſt is, who it as far above all precious ſtones, and a great deale more, then they are above common ſtones. For the ſetting out of this, conſider how Chriſt excels all other precious ſtones.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>He excels them in largeneſſe.</hi> Other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtones are but of a ſmall dimenſion, and of a very little weight. You may put many of the largeſt, that ever were ſeen, into a ſmall Cabinet, but Jeſus Chriſt is very great. As God,
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:38484:221"/>
he is infinite without dimenſion, filling heaven and earth with his preſence. See how the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaks of the infiniteneſs, and incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibleneſſe of Chriſt in regard of his divine nature, <hi>Eſay</hi> 40. 12, 13. <hi>Who hath meaſured the waters in the hollow of his hand? and meted out the heaven with a ſpan? and comprehended the duſt of the earth in a meaſure, and weighed the mountaines in ſcales, and the hills in a ballance.</hi> That all this is ſpoken of Chriſt, appeares from <hi>verſe</hi> 11. where he is prophecied of, as the Shepherd of his flock.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>He excels them in duration.</hi> Other pearles and precious ſtones are of a periſhing nature, they may be defaced, broken, diſſolved; they may loſe their beauty. There's a day coming when they ſhall be melted away into nothing. <hi>Cleopatra</hi> diſſolved a pearle of very great worth, by the Art of Chymiſtry, and drank it at one draught to her <hi>Antonius.</hi> But Jeſus Chriſt is a durable precious ſtone. Neither time nor eternity will be able to diſſolve this ſtone; His beauty cannot be loſt or dimiſhed; He never will have any flaw, or crack, or ſpot in him, in the eyes of thoſe that are able to judge aright of him. His brightneſſe is an unfading brightneſſe. <hi>The heavens and the earth fade, and wax old like a garment,</hi> but Jeſus Chriſt is ſtill the <hi>ſame, and his years have no end,</hi> Heb. 1. 11, 12. And</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>He excels them in the multiplicity and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his properties.</hi> There is not any preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtone that hath all excellencies and vertues in it. Some excel in one property, ſome are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent for another vertue. Whether their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal vertues be conſidered, or their other
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:38484:222"/>
excellencies, as their colour, their forme, their roundneſſe, &amp;c. One excels moſt in this kinde, another in that. But the vertues and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of all pearls and precious ſtones meet in Chriſt. Whatſoever perfection is to be found in any created ſtone, the ſame is to be found in Chriſt. The properties of the Saphire, the Diamond, the Chryſolite, the Sardonix, the Amethiſt, and of all other ſtones meet in Chriſt alone. And then they are all in him in a farre more tranſcendent manner then they are in any of theſe. His brightneſſe is above the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Diamond, his whiteneſſe far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the whiteneſſe of the Pearl. The medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal and phyſical properties that are in Chriſt, are far more excellent then thoſe that are in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther precious ſtones. Some Pearls, they ſay, do ſtrengthen the heart; others clear the ſight; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers remove the <hi>vertigo</hi> or <hi>dizzineſſe</hi> of the head, and many other uſeful properties are recorded by learned men; but none of them are ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in any of theſe kindes as Chriſt is, for he removes and heales the diſtempers of the ſoule and minde, as well as of the body; he cures the ſpiritual eye-ſight, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 18. He cures the troubles of the conſcience, which no other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtone can do, being never ſo artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally uſed. He being rightly applyed and taken, cures the ſoul of ſinne, removes guilt, which none other precious ſtone can do. The neck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of pearle cannot cure the wounds of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, the girdle of diamonds cannot remove tremblings from the ſpirit; the coſtly jewel in the boſome cannot quiet the heart, throbbing for ſin or Gods departure; all this Chriſt can do. And</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="427" facs="tcp:38484:222"/>
4. <hi>He excels them in this, that he hath no hurtful qualities.</hi> Other precious ſtones have a killing quality, powder of diamonds they ſay is poyſonful, put in the bowels or throat, takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way life preſently. But Jeſus Chriſt hath no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive quality. He is occaſion of hurt to none, but to him that refuſeth him. Put all theſe together, and it will appeare, that the Church of God which is erected upon, and united unto ſuch a precious foundation, muſt needs be a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Church.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The great riches of true beleevers.</hi> A mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Chriſt, how poore ſoever he is in regard of outward riches, yet he is the richeſt man in the world, for he doth poſſeſſe Chriſt, who is a ſtone of invaluable worth. If you knew a man had an eſtate worth all the precious ſtones in the world, you would account him a very rich man. A believer hath one precious ſtone in his poſſeſſion, which is of greater worth then all the precious ſtones, which now are, or ever were in the world. When other men boaſt of their jewels, do you boaſt of your Chriſt. When others tell you what rich ſparkling dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds they have, do you bring out this preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtone and lay it before them. When you hear other men ſpeaking of the coſtly foundation of their houſes, do you think what a glorious foundation your ſoules are built upon. He that wants Chriſt is the truly poore man, whatever he enjoyes. He is rich, we ſay, whom God loves, he is rich that inherits Chriſt; if thou haddeſt thy houſe full of diamonds, thou wouldeſt judge thy ſelf a wealthy man. If Chriſt be thine, thou haſt much more. <hi>I counſel thee to buy of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="428" facs="tcp:38484:223"/>
not the gold of the earth, but Chriſts gold that makes men rich. Though thou haſt no houſe to put thy head in, not a footbredth of land to tread upon, though thou haſt not one penny in thy purſe, yet if thou art a true beleever, thou art more wealthy then the greateſt Emperour or Monarch in the world, that hath not Chriſt for his portion. Thou haſt a precious ſtone which wil ſerve to ſpend upon to eternity, &amp; never waſte nor diminiſh. Thus much for Information.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>For Examination. Let us try whether Jeſus Chriſt be precious to us.</hi> Many are deceived in their thoughts about Chriſt. Abundance think they eſteeme him to be a precious ſtone, who do indeed account him but an ordinary ſtone. It will be neceſſary therefore to lay down ſome notes to diſtinguiſh a true eſteeme of Chriſt from a falſe eſteeme. I ſhall name theſe four, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Whether you are willing to part with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing you have, that you may enjoy Chriſt?</hi> Our Saviour layes this down as an evidence of a real prizing of Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 46. he went and ſold all that he had and bought it. Not as if Chriſt were our purchaſe, for he is the Fathers free gift, <hi>John</hi> 3. 16. but the meaning is, that he that eſteemes Chriſt as a pearle of price, will let nothing ſtand in the way between him and Chriſt; he will part with every thing, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then go without him. By this the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul</hi> evidences his eſteeme of Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 7, 8. <hi>What things were gaine to me, thoſe I counted loſſe for Christ, &amp;c.</hi> He that eſteemes Chriſt aright, will leave all his ſinnes for Chriſt.

No termes are hard, no conditions difficult, ſo that Chriſt may be poſſeſſed. He that will not let every thing go that hinders him from Chriſt, doth not eſteeme Chriſt truly precious. That young man in the Goſpel did declare that Chriſt was not precious to him, becauſe he would not part with his riches to enjoy him, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 23. <hi>He went away ſorrowful, for he was very rich.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>What deſire have you of fellowſhip with Christ?</hi> He that eſteems Chriſt precious indeed, thinks he hath never enough of Chriſt. The Church teſtifies her dear eſteeme of him, by her paſſionate deſire of communion with him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>Abundle of myrrh is my welbeloved to me, he ſhall lodge all night between my breaſts.</hi> The breaſt is the place of affections.

He will neglect no oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, he will miſſe willingly no meeting, where he thinks Chriſt may be found. <hi>Tell me, O thou whom my ſoul loveth, where thou feedeſt!</hi> Cant. 1. 7. Jeſus Chriſt is much in the thoughts of him that truly eſteemes him; he is never at eaſe, but when Chriſt lies with him; he likes no diſcourſe ſo well as that that hath Chriſt in it. He is a man even ſwallowed up with the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Chriſt.</p>

3. <hi>Is every thing of Chriſt precious to you?</hi> He that hath right appreciations of Chriſt, doth account him every way precious. His precepts are as precious as his promiſes; his life is as precious as his death; his holy ſteps are as precious as his blood. Many men think they account very highly of Chriſt, who do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed account meanly of him. They cry him up in his ſufferings and ſatisfaction, and cry him down as much in his obedience. The promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Chriſt are ſweet, but the precepts of Chriſt are bitter. His meritorious death is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extold; but his exemplary life is but meanly accounted of: his Prieſtly office is glorious to them, but his Kingly and Prophetical offices are contemptible. They would have Chriſt to ſave them, but they deſire not Chriſt to ſanctifie them. They do indeed cry up Jeſus, but they cry down Chriſt. They prize his blood, but they deſpiſe his graces. They like Chriſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion, but they do not like his Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; they would have him glorifie them in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but they will not allow him to command them on earth. All ſuch partial prizing of Chriſt is no prizing of Chriſt. As the right receiving of Chriſt is to receive him wholly, ſo the right prizing of Chriſt is to prize him whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. He is not prized at all, if he be any way deſpired. The Apoſtle tells us, that <hi>Chriſt is made unto us of God, wiſdom, righteouſneſſe, ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, redemption,</hi> in 1 Cor. 1. 30. He that doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem him aright, muſt eſteem him in this latitude; he is to be honoured as much as he is a Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyer, as he is to be honoured as a Redeemer. The Church values Chriſt wholly, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 11, 12, &amp;c. <hi>His head, his lock<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="431" facs="tcp:38484:224"/>
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Many do much value the hands of Chriſt by which he gives rewards, but they do not value the lips of Chriſt, by which he gives com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. A true prizer of Chriſt eſteemes his mouth as much as his hands, yea he eſteems the precepts of his mouth as well as the promiſes of his mouth.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>What opinion have you of thoſe that are like Chriſt?</hi> It is an eternal truth, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever hath a right eſteeme of Chriſt, cannot but value thoſe that are like him, and that meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe they have his image. Heare what the Apoſtle ſaith expreſly to this purpoſe, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>Every one that loveth him that begat, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth him alſo that is begotten of him.</hi> He that ſaith he looks upon Chriſt as precious, and hates them that are like him, is a lyar, &amp; the truth is not in him. God will ſet ſuch men down not for the prizers, but for the deſpiſers of Chriſt. Thus much for examination.</p>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>Bleſſe God for this precious ſtone.</hi> The more excellent Chriſt is, the more ſhould our hearts he enlarged to bleſſe God for him. How exceeding great is his love to his Church, that hath laid for their foundation ſuch a precious ſtone as Chriſt is; had he not greatly and dearly loved you, he would not have parted with this precious ſtone out of his boſome. He had given you nothing, if he had not not given you Chriſt, and now you have Chriſt he will not deny you any thing. The Apoſtle argues ſtrongly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 32. <hi>He that ſpared not his own Sonne, &amp;c. how ſhall he not together with him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo</hi>
               <pb n="432" facs="tcp:38484:225"/>
               <hi>freely give us all things?</hi> God hath taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all ground of queſtioning other things, from them to whom he hath given Chriſt. He that gives a man freely his beſt jewel, will not ſtick with him for a few common ſtones. Let not a day go over your heads without praiſes to God for Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Let this encourage every one to build on him.</hi> We have encouragement enough to build on him, becauſe he is elected of God; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement alſo, becauſe he is ſo precious. Build not your ſalvation on thoſe rotten ſtones of merit, or free-will, &amp;c. but upon this precious ſtone Jeſus Chriſt. He undoes himſelf, who leaves this precious corner-ſtone for any meane coner-ſtone which God hath never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned. He is an unwiſe Chriſtian that refuſeth a foundation of precious ſtone to build on a ſandy foundation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Whatever hath reference to Chriſt, let it be precious.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaks of precious faith, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 1. Faith is precious, becauſe it layes hold on ſo precious a Chriſt, and on ſo precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and becauſe it works ſuch precious effects, &amp;c. We ſhould have a care that that faith which hath to do with Chriſt be actively precious. 'Tis precious when its right bred, and when it's active, when it's of the beſt ſort. So love Chriſt with a precious love, not with ordinary, but with choice affection. Fear Chriſt with a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious feare. Obey Chriſt with a precious o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, that is, obedience of the beſt kinde. Worſhip Chriſt with precious worſhip. It will be another character that Chriſt is precious to us, when we have a care that every thing that refers to him be choice and precious. <hi>Curſed is the decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi>

            <p n="1">1. Offence given, or Active ſcandal, is, when the errour or fault is on his part, which layes the ſcandal. This is twofold, <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalum, Contristationis,</hi> Or <hi>Lapſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Scandalum Contriſtationis.</hi> An offence or ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal of grief when any thing is done or ſaid which gives juſt occaſion of ſorrow unto our brethren. Of this the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 21. and <hi>v.</hi> 15.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Scandalum lapſus.</hi> An offence or ſcandal of falling is, when any thing is ſpoken or done whereby an occaſion of ſinning is given to our
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:38484:227"/>
brethren. Of this the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 9, 10, 11. This is done either by evil counſel, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 23. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 18. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 14. By evil ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, <hi>Eſay</hi> 9. 16. <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 14. Or by abuſe of Chriſtian liberty, in the uſe of things indifferent, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. and 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 8.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Offence taken, or paſſive ſcandal, is, when things or words which are both good and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, are by ſiniſter and perverſe malignity of minde made an occaſion of offence. Thus the doctrine of Chriſts crucifying was an offence and ſcandal to the Jewes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 23. It was fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to the wiſe ſelf-conceited Greeks, and it was a ſtumbling block to the malignant Jews.</p>
            <p>Now when the Apoſtle ſaith, Chriſt is a ſtone of ſtumbling and rock of offence. We are to underſtand it paſſively, not Actively. Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, nor any thing of Chriſt, is no juſt occaſion of offence to any; he lived and died without giving juſt offence to any. His counſel was good, his example was holy, his whole converſation was ſo ordered, that none could juſtly be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at him. And yet through the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their hearts, many did then, and do ſtill, to their own ruine, take offence at him. The Obſervation is this, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>The Lord Jeſus Chriſt is to wicked men a ſtone of ſtumbling and a rock of offence.</hi> Though Chriſt be in himſelf a precious corner-ſtone of Gods own appointment and chuſing, yet do wicked men make him to be unto themſelves a ſtone of ſtumbling, and a rock of offence. It's very common and ordinary for wicked men to be offended, and to ſtumble at Jeſus Chriſt.
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:38484:227"/>
Many places of Scripture do make mention of the offence which the wicked ſhould take at Chriſt. See <hi>Eſay</hi> 8. 14, 15. Though theſe words be not ſpoken directly, yet they are ſpoken typically of Chriſt. <hi>Adumbratus fuit Chriſtus, qui non inſtar arcis, ſed offendiculi potius Iſraelitis futurus erat,</hi> ſaith <hi>Calvin</hi> upon the place. Though Chriſt be in himſelf a Sanctuary, and be ſo to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, yet to the ungodly and carnal, he is both a ſtone of ſtumbling, and a rock of offence. As, many are gathered and ſaved by him, ſo ſhall many be broken, and ſnared, and taken becauſe of him. To this agrees that old prophecy of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon</hi> concerning Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 34. <hi>Behold,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>this childe is ſet for the fall and riſing againe of many in Iſrael,</hi> and for a ſigne which ſhall be ſpoken againſt. And as it was foretold of him, ſo we read in the Goſpel, that it was fulfilled concerning him; many were cauſleſly offended at him. In the handling of this point, I ſhall open theſe two things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. What it is in Chriſt at which men ſtumble and take offence.</item>
               <item>2. Whence it is that they do take of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</item>
            </list>
            <p>We ſhall ſhew firſt the matter of the offence. Secondly, the occaſion of this cauſleſſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the firſt. There are many occaſions of offence which men take at Chriſt, I reduce all to theſe three heads.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>ſome ſtumble and take offence at his p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> I mean the meanneſſe of his perſon. This was the great ſtumbling block of the Jewes. They looked for a Meſſiah of noble birth and Parentage, that ſhould ſway the Scepter of
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:38484:228"/>
               <hi>David</hi> with much outward pomp and glory. They expected that all thoſe propheſies, which ſpeak of the glory of Chriſts perſon, ſhould have been literally fulfilled, therefore they took of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence at him. His birth was mean, his paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage low and ordinary, his attendance ſmall, his education and breeding contemptible, this made them ſtumble. The Prophet foretels this of the Jews, <hi>Eſay</hi> 53. <hi>init.</hi> he ſhall grow up before him as a tender plant, &amp;c. There is no forme nor comelineſſe in him that we ſhould deſire him. They looked for outward ſplendor, and becauſe they did not finde it, they were offended. The Evangeliſt ſpeaks fully of this, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 54, 55, 56, 57. <hi>Is not this,</hi> ſay they, <hi>the Carpenters ſon, &amp;c?</hi> They did not conſider that the Son of man <hi>came not to be miniſtred unto, but to Miniſter,</hi> that he came to be a ſervant, that he was made under the law, and therefore were ſcandalized at his meanneſſe. We may adde to this his ſhameful and ignominious death which he ſuffered, this was a great offence to the Jews. They do to this day upbraid Chriſtians with that curſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 5. <hi>Curſed is the man that truſteth in man, and maketh fleſh his arme.</hi> Chriſt crucified is to this day a ſtumbling block to the Jewes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>ſome ſtumble at his Doctrine.</hi> The Doctrine which Chriſt preached, and which by his appointment, is publiſhed, is very glorious, yet it is an occaſion of offence to the world. The <hi>Arians</hi> are offended at the Doctrine of his <hi>Divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> The <hi>Manichees</hi> at the doctrine of his <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity.</hi> The Socinians are offended at the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of his <hi>ſatisfaction.</hi> The Papiſts at his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>juſtification</hi> by faith alone. The Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:38484:228"/>
and Arminians are offended at his doctrine, of nullifying the power of nature in things ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural. The Antinomians ſtumble at his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the ratification of the moral law, &amp;c. The Phariſees were offended at his doctrine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt tradition, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 11, 12. But to come to particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The ſtrictneſſe of his doctrine is a ſtumbling block to many.</hi> The doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt is very ſtrict, it condemnes not onely actual ſinne, but the very ſinful riſings of corruption in the heart. He that <hi>looks upon a woman,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>to luſt after her, hath committed adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with her in his heart,</hi> Mat. 5. 28. ſo v. 29. <hi>If thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and caſt it from thee, &amp;c. Duri ſermones durioris Magistri,</hi> have ſome ſaid of theſe words. They are hard ſayings of a hard maſter. If we conſider the duties of the Goſpel, they are not onely barely to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, but they are to be performed cordially, ſincerely, elſe they are not accepted. <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul, and with all thy minde, and with all thy ſtrength.</hi> Corrupt nature would have full ſwinge and liberty, the Doctrine of Chriſt will not allow it, therefore is offence taken at it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The ſpirituality of his Doctrine offends others.</hi> The Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt in the Goſpel is a very ſpiritual doctrine, John 6. 63. <hi>The words which I ſpeak to you,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>they are Spirit, and they are life.</hi> 'Tis the honour of Chriſts Doctrine, that it is not fleſhly, but ſpiritual, and they that are ſpiritual love it, becauſe of its ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality. You may ſee the ſpiritualneſſe, and efficacy of the Word, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 12. it's quick, and
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:38484:229"/>
powerful, and mighty in operation, ſharper then a two edged ſword, piercing even to the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding aſunder of ſoul and ſpirit, &amp;c. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe men are carnal, they are offended at a ſpiritual word. The Apoſtle calls it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>James</hi> 1. 21. A carnal heart doth not love the word ſhould be an <hi>engraffed word.</hi> They are contented it ſhould come into their eares, but they do not love it ſhould ſink into their hearts, therefore are they offended at it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The myſticalneſſe of his Doctrine, is a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling ſtone to others.</hi> The Doctrine of Chriſt in his Goſpel is a doctrine very myſterious, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. 'Tis in many things above reaſon. The Doctrine of the Trinity of perſons in the unity of eſſence, is above reaſon that God ſhould be one, and yet three. The Doctrine of the the two natures in the perſon of Chriſt. Theſe and many others are above reaſon. The do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of ſelf-denial. The doctrine of loſing a mans life to ſave it, the doctrine of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of the reſurrection of the body, theſe are very myſterious. And becauſe they are ſo, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence is taken at them, read <hi>John</hi> 6. 51, 52. how were the Jews offended, becauſe he had preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that, <hi>except men did eat his fleſh and blood, they had no life in them?</hi> They ſtrove among themſelves, ſaying, <hi>How can this man give us his fleſh to eat?</hi> nay, not onely the Jewes, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Diſciples alſo were offended at this doctrine, <hi>v.</hi> 60, 61. The myſticalneſſe and height of the Goſpel, and doctrines of it do offend now to this day.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The ſimplicity of his doctrine is an offence to others.</hi> The Doctrine of Chriſt in the Goſpel is laid down with great plainneſſe. Though the
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:38484:229"/>
Goſpel be ſufficiently Rhetorical, yet it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with much plainneſſe. The pen-men of Scripture did purpoſely avoid the entiſing words of mens wiſdome, leſt they ſhould corrupt the hearts of men from the ſimplicity that is in Chriſt. 'Tis the excellency of the Goſpel, that it is ſet down in plainneſſe and ſimplicity. Painting is fitter for harlots then for chaſte women. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked truth is beſt; if other dreſſes be put upon it, it is corrupted. The wiſe Greeks ſtumbled at this ſtumbling ſtone. They thought <hi>Tully</hi> and <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> were more eloquent then the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Prophets. The Apoſtle ſpeaks fully to this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 17, 18, 22, 23. Many are to this day offended at this very thing, they think there are not thoſe ſtrains of wit in the writings of the Apoſtles as are in other writings, when as the truth is, the higheſt eloquence, is the eloquence of God in the Scriptures.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>The ſeverity of his Doctrine is a ſtumbling ſtone to others.</hi> The Law and Goſpel do both threaten damnation for diſobedience, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitence. The axe is laid to the root of the tree, ſaith <hi>John,</hi> Mat. 3. 10. <hi>Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewen down and caſt into the fire. He that beleeveth not is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned already,</hi> Mark 16. 16. Many are greatly offended at this. They would have <hi>ſmooth things,</hi> but they love not this ſeverity. They do not conſider that as the Goſpel is ſevere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſinne, ſo is it exceeding full of comfort to all penitent ſinners. And then,</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>The conſequences of his Dactrine is an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to others.</hi> I ſhall onely mention two things which do ordinarily follow the doctrine of the Goſpel, they are theſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="442" facs="tcp:38484:230"/>
Firſt, <hi>reproaches and perſecutions.</hi> Seldom do men receive the Doctrine of Chriſt in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but the devil and his inſtruments raiſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution leſſe or more againſt them. You may trace the Goſpel by the blood of thoſe that have profeſſed it. <hi>They gnaſhed upon Steven with their teeth,</hi> ſaith the ſtory, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 52, 54. and at laſt ſtoned him with ſtones, that he died. <hi>Quid eſt predicare</hi> (ſaith <hi>Luther) niſi furorem po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puli in ſe derivare?</hi> To preach the Goſpel, is to draw the fury of the world upon a mans ſelf. And to profeſſe the Goſpel in ſincerity and zeal, is to make a mans ſelf a prey to the wicked. This offends many. Our Saviour foretels this. See two texts, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 21. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 9. 10. The preſecution which hath followed upon Chriſts Doctrine, hath made thouſands ſcandali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed at Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Diviſions and contentions.</hi> Though Chriſt be <hi>the Prince of peace,</hi> and his Goſpel the Goſpel of peace, yet accidentally, by reaſon of mens corruptions it cauſes great diviſions, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 49. <hi>I am come,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>to ſend fire on the earth, and what will I, if it be already kindled?</hi> ſo <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 34, 35. Theſe are not the effects, but the conſequence of the Goſpel, it meets with mens corruptions, which, becauſe they will not have deſtroyed, they are inraged. This offends many. Hence ſome have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanely wiſhed that the Bible were burnt, they have looked upon it as the great make-bate, and incendiary of the world. Thus is the Doctrine of Chriſt made a ſtone of ſtumbling, and a rock of offence.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Some ſtumble and take offence at his Kingdome.</hi> I meane not onely at his internal
<pb facs="tcp:38484:230"/>
Adminiſtration of his Kingdome by his Spirit in the heart, but alſo at the external adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. I ſhall reduce all I have to ſay to theſe two heads.</p>

Men do take much offence, though cauſleſly at theſe, decrying, reviling them as if they were not of God. <hi>Ye take too much upon you, ye ſonnes of Levi? all the Lords people are holy, Numb.</hi> 16. 3. All men are Miniſters, all may preach; there's no ſuch office as Miniſter in the Scripture. There's no ſuch thing as Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler in the Church. The cenſures they alſo give offence to many. Admonition, Suſpenſion, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, men are greatly offended at all theſe. The government is too ſtrict, too ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, 'tis tyrannical, theſe are the bitter words of men.

            <p n="1">1. <hi>Many are offended at their paucity.</hi> Though Chriſts ſubjects be many ſimply conſidered, yet comparatively they are but few. <hi>Narrow is th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

hundred ſervants to Chriſts one. <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhuab</hi> onely entred into <hi>Canaan</hi> of all the men that came out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> This cauſes many to ſtumble at Chriſt. Shall we be wiſer then others? <hi>This one man came in to ſojourne, and he will needs be a judge, ſay thoſe ſonnes of Belial concerning Lot,</hi> Gen. 19. 9. It's a great ſcandal that ſo few come in.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Many are offended becauſe of their meanneſſe and poverty.</hi> Few of the great men of the world ſubmit truly to Chriſt. <hi>Not many wiſe, not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny noble, not many mighty hath God choſen,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, but <hi>the fooliſh things of the world, &amp;c.</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 26, 27. Our Saviour did foreſee that this would be an occaſion of ſtumbling to men, therefore he layes in a caveat againſt it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 4, 5, 6. <hi>Go and tell John,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>what you have ſeen and heard. The blinde receive their ſight, &amp;c. and bleſſed is he that ſhall not be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended in me.</hi> The rich and wealthy oppoſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Chriſt. Silk and Scarlet, Gold and Silver do very rarely follow Chriſt. This offends ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, <hi>John</hi> 7. 48. ſay the Phariſees, <hi>have any of the Rulers beleeved in him,</hi> but this people that knoweth not the Law is accurſed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The miſcarriages of which they are guilty.</hi> The beſt of Chriſts ſubjects being but ſanctified in part; and having ſuch a ſubtle divel to aſſault, do too frequently miſcarry and fall into ſinne. This cauſes many to be offended. Wicked men though they never obſerve the holy actions of the godly, yet they will obſerve their infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities. One ſinne is more talked of then an hundred acts of holineſſe. This is a ſtumbling block to the wicked. See what God ſaith of <hi>Davids</hi> ſinne, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 14. They that
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:38484:231"/>
would learne nothing by <hi>Davids</hi> piety, did take offence at his ſinne. Though it be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable that men ſhould be offended at Chriſt for the failings of his ſervants, yet it is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The ſad Apoſtaſie of thoſe that have profeſſed ſubjection to him.</hi> There are in Chriſts family many rotten-hearted profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours. The falling of theſe is an occaſion why many are offended at Chriſt. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſpeaks of this, <hi>Matthew</hi> 26. 56. The fall of ſuch hardens the hearts of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny againſt Chriſt and his Religion, <hi>John</hi> 6. 66.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Ignorance of Chriſt.</hi> Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is one great cauſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſtumbling, <hi>John</hi> 11. 9, 10. <hi>If any man walk in the night he ſtumbleth, becauſe there is no light in him.</hi> The ſpiritual blindneſs of the minde is one principal reaſon why the world ſtumbleth at Chriſt. They know not the glory of his perſon, they know not the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of his Doctrine, they know not the nature of his Kingdome, therefore they take offence at him. This is that which the Apoſtle men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 8. This ignorance of Chriſt ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth partly <hi>from want of ſtudying his Word.</hi> They do not ſearch the record which is given to Chriſt in the Scriptures; partly, <hi>from their infidelity,</hi> they will not believe the report given of him, by ſuch a have the knowledge of him.

<pb n="447" facs="tcp:38484:232"/>
Conſult thoſe two texts, and the trath of this will appeare. The one is, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 21, 22, 23. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 14. The blindneſſe of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees did ariſe from the groſſe ignorance of the Phariſees.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Precipitancy and raſhneſſe.</hi> Though a man have eyes to ſee, yet if he be heedleſſe and raſh, his foot may ſtumble in a plaine way. A <hi>careleſſe eye</hi> occaſions a <hi>ſtumbling foot.</hi> The greateſt part of men are heedleſſe in ſpiritual matters, <hi>They ruſh on as the horſe ruſhes into the battel,</hi> Jer. 8. 6. The Scripture ſpeaks of ponder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſteps of our feet. 'Tis the Wiſe-mans counſel, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 25, 26. Moſt men neglect this counſel in the things of Chriſt. They walk at all adventure, turning their eyes, now this way, now that way, and through their carleſneſſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretion in not examining things, they take of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and fall. The Apoſtles advice is, <hi>to try, and prove all things,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5. 21. Adviſedneſſe and deliberation in the matters of God is a ſpecial vertue. Moſt men are of a hurrying ſpirit, and this makes them ſtumble.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Heart distemperedneſſe.</hi> A man that hath either un intoxicated head, or a diſeaſed body, ſoon ſtumbles. Wicked men have hearts full of diſtempers. There are many unmortified luſts in their hearts, which they are not willing to part with, pride, paſſion, uncleanneſſe, &amp;c. Theſe are indulged. Theſe they will not part with. They love ſome ſinne better then Chriſt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot have Chriſt and their ſinnes, they are offended. This is hinted to u in the text. Such as ſtumble at the Word, are ſaid to be diſobedient. He that allows any ſinne unrepented of in his heart, will ſooner or
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:38484:233"/>
later ſtumble at Chriſt. See <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 14. <hi>The Phariſees who were covetous, derided Chriſt.</hi> Our Saviour tells them they could not ſerve God and Mammon, and they being given to covetouſneſs were ſcandalized, and derided him, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, they ſnuffed at him as the word ſignifies. Walking in uprightneſſe, and being without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence are joyned together, Phil. 1. 10. An by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical and profane heart will be a ſtumbling heart. He that walks up to the knees in mire may eaſily ſtumble. Wicked men walk up to the very loynes in the mire of ſinful diſtempers, and this cauſes them to be offended at Chriſt. <hi>The way of the righteous</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) is made plaine,</hi> Prov. 15. 19. It's raiſed up as a Cauſey. Godly men walk in plaine even wayes, wicked men walk in rough, uneven, myry wayes, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſtumble at Chriſt. They are burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the load of ſinne, therefore they ſtumble.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Hatred of Chriſt.</hi> Hatred will take offence at every thing done or ſaid by the perſon hated. As love doth interpret all to the beſt, ſo hatred interprets all to the worſt. <hi>Ahab</hi> hated <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caiah,</hi> and therefore took offence at every thing he ſaid. You may read the ſtory, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. 8. Now wicked men ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e Chriſt with a perfect ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred. There is diſſimilitude between Chriſt and them, and becauſe of that cruel hatred. They are impure, Chriſt is pure; they are unholy, Chriſt is holy. As ſimilitude breeds love, ſo diſſimilitude creates hatred. You reade, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 14. that <hi>Chriſts own Citizens hated him.</hi> Chriſt is hated not only by foreigners, but by them of his own houſhold. Where there is hatred, there will be offence, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 10. <hi>Many ſhall be</hi>
               <pb n="449" facs="tcp:38484:233"/>
               <hi>offended and they ſhall hate one another.</hi> Till the ſoul lay aſide its hatred it will not ceaſe to ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at every thing of, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief.</hi> Infidelity is the cauſe of ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling. This may be gathered clearly from the text compared with the foregoing <hi>ver. unto you that believe he is precious, but unto them that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers he is a ſtone of ſtumbling.</hi> Moſt men walk by ſenſe, and not by faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they ſee the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of Chriſt in his Goſpel, but they do not ſee the beautiful inſide of Chriſt, they ſee that in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which appeares unpleaſing and bitter; but they want faith to ſee that which is ſweet and lovely, therefore they are ſcandalized.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>The bad example of others.</hi> Examples have a very great efficacy and operation, whether they be good or bad; good examples are great ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings to them that are good; and bad examples are great provocations to them that are bad, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaks of this 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 10. <hi>Aſahels lying dead in the way occaſioned a ſtop in the march of others,</hi> 2 Sam. 2. 23. One wicked man eyes the example of another, and becauſe he ſees that ſuch and ſuch were offended at Chriſt, eſpecially if they be learned, wiſe, &amp;c. he upon that very example takes offence likewiſe. Thus much for the expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>

            <p>For information. It teacheth us theſe four leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>This may fortifie us againſt being dejected becauſe of the offence which wicked men take at as cauſleſly.</hi> It is too frequent to ſee wicked men ſcandalized at the people of God even for their holy actions.

They are offended with you for your prayers, for your non compliance with them in their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful wayes, for their ſtrict obſerving of the Sabbath, &amp;c. The Apoſtle mentions this, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>The beſt actions of the godly are occaſions of ſtumbling to the wicked.</hi> Well; this text may greatly help the people of God againſt being offended, ſo as to deſpond becauſe of ſuch cauſleſſe offence. If Chriſt was a ſtone of ſtumbling is it any great matter if we be ſtones of ſtumbling? If they were offended at Chriſt, will they not be offended at us? It is enough for the Diſciple that he be as his maſter. Gods people ſhould take care that they give no occaſion of ſtumbling to the worſt of men; but if they will take offence at the holy practiſes, Gods people ſhould ſet but very little by ſuch offences, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 14. eſpecially conſidering the cloſe of the text; whereunto they were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>

            <p>Firſt, <hi>Bleſſe God that Chriſt is not a ſtumbling ſtone to you.</hi> That neither his perſon, nor his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, nor his Kingdome do offend you. The time was when you were off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nded with Chriſt as much as any; and if God ſhould leave you to your ſelves, you would ſtumble upon him again. That you are enabled to cloſe with his perſon, to embrace his doctrine, to ſubmit to his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without offence, is a mighty mercy, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially now, when ſo many are ſcandalized, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 6.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Labour ſo to carry your ſelves, that ye may not occaſion others to be offended at Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 32. <hi>Paul</hi> was very careful of it himſelf, <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 16 The ſinfulneſſe of Profeſſours will make men take offence at Chriſt. The doctrine of Chriſt the government of Chriſt will be ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at, if you have not care of your ways more then ordinary. If you take not heed to your ſelves, both in matter of opinion and practice, you will pave a way to make many fall upon Chriſt himſelf. Your miſcarriages refl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ct diſhonour both upon Chriſts perſon and doctrine. <hi>Give no offence</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 3. That the Miniſtry be not blamed; Chriſtianity
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:38484:235"/>
will be blamed, yea, Chriſt himſelf will be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, if you be not careful to avoid miſcarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. And beſides you will be inſtrumental to damne the ſouls of your brethren for whom Chriſt dyed. Remember that of our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 7. <hi>Wo unto that man by whom the offence cometh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. For the wicked. Take heed of making Chriſt any longer a ſtumbling ſtone. It's a very ſad thing to ſtumble at Chriſt. Let me ſhew it you in theſe five particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>It's a very ſinful thing.</hi> The ſinfulneſſe of it appears in this.</p>
            <p n="1">(1) <hi>It's a charging of wickedneſſe upon Chriſt.</hi> He that takes offence at Chriſt, what doth he but ſay, that there is ſomething in Chriſt which is matter of exception? To make Chriſt a ſtumbling ſtone, is either to profeſſe that Chriſt is blame worthy, or that thy ſelf art fooliſh. What a high ſinne is it to aſperſe Chriſt the holy one with any miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage? he was holy harmleſſe, undefiled ſeparate from ſinners, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7 26 And</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Its the inlet to other ſinnes.</hi> It hinders the ſoul, 1. From loving Chriſt with that love that love that is meet. 2 From obeying Chriſt. 3. From beleeving in Chriſt. 4. From recommending him to others. 5. From being thankful for Chriſt. 6. It turnes the ſoul upon the ſinne of blaſpheming and reviling Chriſt. 7 I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> hinders the ſoul from ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for Chriſt. He that ſtumbles at Chriſt is in the high-way to all kinde of ſin againſt Chriſt; he may eaſily be perſwaded to ſet up another Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It's a very dangerous thing.</hi> It's dangerous in theſe two reſpects.</p>
            <p>For firſt, <hi>It makes all that Chriſt hath done or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered</hi>
               <pb n="454" facs="tcp:38484:236"/>
               <hi>of no effect to us.</hi> He that ſtumbles at Chriſt cuts himſelf off from all the merits and benefits of Chriſts death, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. We may ſay of ſuch a one, as <hi>Paul</hi> doth of circumciſion, <hi>Gal</hi> 5. 4.</p>
            <p>Nay, ſecondly, <hi>It makes Chriſt, damnation to a perſon.</hi> That of our Saviour is a dreadful Text, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 44. To turne ſalvation into damnation will be a double damnation; better to have been damned without a Chriſt, then to be damned with a Chriſt; better a thouſand times to have been deſtroyed without a Redeemer, then to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by a Redeemer; better to die without a Saviour, then to die by a Saviour.</p>
            <p>What ſhould be done that we may ſtumble no more? 1. Get a clear knowledge of Chriſt. 2. Be acquainted with thoſe that embrace him. 3. Be truly offended at ſin. 4. Pray that God would root out of your hearts all occaſions of offence. 5. Remember what Chriſt hath done for you, and what he is ſtill a doing for you; His doctrines, his offices, his government; All that at which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence is taken, is for your benefit and ſalvation. 6. To take offence at Chriſt, is to ſtumble at Gods wiſdom, mercy, goodneſſe in giving Chriſt, and in fitting Chriſt.</p>

hath viſited us. In the handling of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, I ſhall by way of Explication open theſe three things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. In what reſpects Chriſt is called the Sunne.</item>
               <item>2. Why he is called the Sunne of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe.</item>
               <item>3. How he doth excell the natural Sunne.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. For the firſt. Chriſt may be compared to the natural Sun in three reſpects.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In reſpect of his own perſon.</hi> The natural Sun hath a ſhadow of two excellencies which are in the perſon of Chriſt. As,</p>
            <p>(1) <hi>His glory and Majeſty.</hi> Of all the viſible works which God hath made, there is not any ſo glorious as the Sunne; it's full of ſplend or, and glory: The Sunne is <hi>Anima munds,</hi> the very ſoul of the world. The brightneſſe of the Sunne is ſo tranſcendent that the weak eye of man is dazzled with the beholding of it. See how <hi>David</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes this creature, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 5. <hi>He is as a bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom coming out of his Chamber.</hi> Never was any bridegroome, no not the greateſt Prince in the world, in ſuch attire on his wedding day, as the Sunne is every morning at his coming out of his Chamber. So glorious is the Sunne, that he draws all the eyes of men to look upon him at his appearing. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt is a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon. The Sunne is but blackneſſe if it be compared with Jeſus Chriſt. His face is ten thouſand times brighter then the Sunne when it is cloathed in its beſt apparel. He is <hi>the bright ſhining of his Fathers glory,</hi> and <hi>the expreſſe image of his perſon,</hi> Heb 1. 3. When he was transfigured upon the mountaine in the ſight of his Diſciples,
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:38484:238"/>
the text ſaith, <hi>His face did ſhine as the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nne, and his rayment as white as the light,</hi> Matth. 17. 2. Could we but ſee the face of Chriſt as it is now ſhining at the right hand of God, we ſhould ſay the Sun were but like ſackcloth in compariſon of it; how much more bright is he in his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head? this is ſo glorious, that <hi>no man can ſee it and live.</hi> The face of Jeſus Chriſt is that which makes and conſtitutes the very glory of heaven. And then.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>His omniſcience.</hi> The Sunne in the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment travels up and down, and beholds every part of the world. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>there is nothing hid from the heat of it,</hi> Pſalm. 19. 6. Jeſus Chriſt as he is the Sonne of God is perfectly omniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of his omniſcience, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 13. There is no creature that is not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in his ſight, &amp;c. Yea, he ſees every thing not by moving up and down as the Sunne doth, but by one fixed and conſtant view. There can be no fence made to keep out the ſight of his eye, he doth <hi>ſimul &amp; ſemel,</hi> together and at once behold all creatures with all their motions, thoughts, and imaginations. This is the firſt.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>In reſpect of his effects and workings upon his people.</hi> There is a great reſemblance between the Suns effects upon the creatures, and Chriſts ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects upon his people. I ſhall inſtance in eight particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Sunne hath an enlightning vertue.</hi> The Sunne is the great luminary which God hath appointed and made to carry the light abroad to the inhabitants of the earth. The preſence of the Sunne makes day. The Sunne is the great torch of heaven, by which men and
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:38484:239"/>
other creatures ſee what to do, and where to go, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 14, 16. By his light we ſee it and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things: Jeſus Chriſt hath an enlightning power, and doth actually enlighten the hearts of men. The ſoul is by nature in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and never ſees till Chriſt beame down his light upon it. All men by nature in regard of ſpiritual light, are as that blinde man was, <hi>John.</hi> 9. 1. without any ſpiritual ſight. They ſee neither ſinnes, blackneſſe, nor their own miſery by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſinne. They ſee not Chriſts beauty, not graces excellency till their eyes are opened. They have thick skales upon their eyes, as <hi>Paul</hi> had before his converſion, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 18. Therefore they are called darkneſſe, and their ſtate a ſtate of darkneſſe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 8. Now Chriſt gives them light. When he riſeth upon them ſavingly, then, and not till then do they ſee their condition, and the way out of it, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 14 As the Sun is <hi>ſpeculum munds,</hi> the worlds looking glaſſe; ſo is Chriſt <hi>ſpeculum Animae,</hi> the ſouls looking glaſſe. All ſpiritual light which is given to the ſoul, is in and thorough Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. So the Apoſtle tells us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6. The Goſpel is the <hi>vehiculum lucis,</hi> the great chariot that carries this light abroad, but the fountaine of it is this bright Sunne of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe Jeſus Chriſt. Spiritual illumination is Chriſts work. This is that which the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 1. 9. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> carried the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orch, but Chriſt himſelf was the light. Till this Sun be up, the ſoul lies in groſſe darkneſſe, but when it appeares then light comes Preſently, <hi>Eſay</hi> 60. 1. When the glory of the Lord is riſen upon the ſoule, then is darkneſſe expell'd, and the ſoul ſhines forth. The heart that is as dark
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:38484:239"/>
as any dungeon; when the beames of this Sunne are darted down into it, is as light as a Paradiſe. Chriſt turnes <hi>Egypt</hi> into <hi>Goſhen.</hi> And then,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Sunne hath a warming vertue.</hi> Though it be not formally hot, yet it is hot in its effect. <hi>Pſal</hi> 19. 6. The beames of the Sunne warme the earth and the ayre, the bodies of the ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and irrational creatures. Experience teacheth that the Sunne hath a heating power; the light and motion of it cauſes heat. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath a warning vertue in him. The heart that is as cold as yee is heated and warmed by the influences of his Spirit into a good temper. The luke-warme heart, when Chriſt ſhines up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it is ſet into a burning heat. The beames which are caſt from Chriſt in his Ordinances, put the cold ſoul into a ſpiritual ſweat. We have an inſtance of this in the two Diſciples, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 32. They were in a freezing temper till Chriſt overtook them, but when they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued a while in that ſpiritual ſun-ſhine, their hearts were put into a violent flame. <hi>Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked with us by the way?</hi> The forerunner of Chriſt tells the Jews, that he that came after him, did baptize men with the holy Ghoſt and with fire, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 11. Chriſt can kindle the ſparks of grace which ſeeme to be as dead, and put them into a burning flame. Many a Saint hath come to the Ordinances with his heart like the cold earth, and before he hath departed, Chriſt hath ſent him away like a burning lamp; the cold water hath been put into a vehement boyling that the heart hath runne over again, <hi>eruct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">3. <hi>The Sunne hath a comforting vertue.</hi> The Sunne is in Scripture put for comfort, <hi>Job.</hi> 30. 28.

Weak and ſickly perſons, when they are brought into the Sunſhine, finde their ſpirits cheered by it. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath a heart-comforting vertue. He is the firſt inlet of comfort into the ſoul. He is the preſerver of joy in the ſoule; and he it is that reſtores joy unto the ſoul after dejections and droopings of heart. <hi>Noah was herein a figure of Christ;</hi> ſee what his father Prophecies of him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y in and through Chriſt. that comfort which is not built upon Chriſt, is baſtard comfort, which will end in terrour. The Spirit of God is called the comforter, <hi>John</hi> 15. 20. his office is immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to cheer the ſoul. How doth he comfort but even by making application to the ſoul of a ſinner of that which is merited for him? All
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:38484:240"/>
the arguments whereby the ſpirit comforts the heart are drawn from Chriſt, he ſeales up to the ſoul that Chriſt is his, and ſo fills it with comfort. And then,</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The Sune hath a healing vertue,</hi> this is in the text. There would be no health amongſt men or any other living creatures, if there were no Sunne. The world would be a Hoſpital if the Sunne were not.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the Sunne dries up cold moiſtures, exhales vapours which would infect the bodies of men and other creatures.</p>
            <p>Secondly the Sunne helps on the growth and vegetation of all healing plants, and in both theſe reſpects hath healing in his wings. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath a healing vertue; he heals both as medicine and Phyſician. His blood is the Phyſick that heals, and he himſelf is the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian that applies it to the ſoul. The Scripture ſpeaks of Chriſt as a healer, <hi>Eſay</hi> 61. 1. He heals the ſoul of the guilt of ſinne by the grace of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, and he heales it of the filthineſſe of ſin by the grace of ſanctification. The Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſpeaks of this, chap. 53. 5. <hi>By his ſtripes we are heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> If Chriſt do but lay his hands upon the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed ſoul, it is cured whatſoever infirmitie be upon it. The very border of his garment, if it be but touched with a hand of faith, cures all the bloody iſſues of the ſoul. You have a rare cure done by the touch of Chriſts garment, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 20. There are thouſands of ſoules in heaven that have found perfect cure of ſtrange diſeaſes under the wings of Chriſt. And then,</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>The Sun hath a melting and ſoftning vertue.</hi> Though it patch and harden the clay, yet it ſoftens the wax; the hot beames of the Sunne melt the

yee, and mollifie the ground when it's frozen into hardneſſe. The Sunne when it was up melted the Manna, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 21. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath a melting and ſoftning vertue; if he do but ſend down one hot gleam upon the ſoul, it's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved and melted like wax. We have an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Chriſts ſoftning vertue in <hi>Peter,</hi> Luke 22 61, 62. his heart was grown as hard as yee by his threefold denial of Chriſt, and yet one beame from the eye of Chriſt thawed this yee into teares. The Lord turned and looked upon <hi>Peter, and he went out and wept bitterly.</hi> Chriſts eyes are like a flame of fire, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 14. Theſe heavenly beames of Chriſt are able to turne the flint-ſtone into ſprings of water. Thoſe three thouſand mentioned, <hi>Acts</hi> 2 37. were as hard as marbles, for they had their hands in the blood of Chriſt, <hi>v.</hi> 36. yet when Chriſt did ſhine upon them in the minſtery of <hi>Peter,</hi> they are ſo ſoft that any frame may be put upon them, <hi>Men and brethren what ſhall we do?</hi> The Jaylor, a rough hardned ſinner that drew blood from the backs of the Apoſtles; yet when Jeſus Chriſt did but ſpread his hot wings upon him even at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, how is he ſoftned? <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 29. 30. he that was lately like a ſtone, is now like wax, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny impreſſion may be put upon him. There is not the moſt ſtiff necked ſinner in this or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Congregation, but if Chriſt put out his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, he can diſtil him into tears of repentance. And then,</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>The Sunne hath a vegetative vertue,</hi> It doth bring on the growth of plants and flowers, and all vegetables. The Sunne darws the ſap from the root into the branches, and makes it th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="465" facs="tcp:38484:241"/>
when the fruit is knit, it ripens it and brings it on to perfection. This is mentioned, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 14. To this <hi>Bildad</hi> alludes. <hi>Job</hi> 8. 16: <hi>He is green before the Sunne, and his branch ſhooteth forth in his garden.</hi> Though the ſoyle be never ſo good, and the husbandry never ſo exact, yet without the Sunne nothing comes to perfection; the fruitfulneſſe of the earth is to be aſcribed to the Sun more then to the Earth or Tillage. Jeſus Chriſt hath a vegetating vertue, he brings on the ſpiritual growth of every grace in the ſoul; did not this Sunne ſend down his beams the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual plantation would come to nothing. The Scripture attributes all Chriſtian growth to Chriſt; he is the root which feeds grace; All ſupplie comes from him. God hath ſtor'd all our nouriſhment in Chriſt, from him to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated as we ſtand in need. The Apoſtle ſets this out in two texts, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 19. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 16. And the Prophet in the text makes it one effect of Chriſts riſing upon the Saints. They ſhall grow up as the calves of the ſtall. You may thank Jeſus Chriſt for the thriving of your graces, as well as for the planting of your graces, <hi>John</hi> 15. 5. And then,</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>The Sunne hath a purifying vertue.</hi> When your garments are mouldy, you hang them out in the Sunne; when your roomes are muſty, you ſet open the windows to let in the Sunne that they may be ſweeten'd. Jeſus Chriſt hath a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying vertue, he makes the heart ſweet, and he keeps it ſweet. See how this Prophet deſcribes him, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 2, 3. he is like a refiners fire, and like fullers ſope, &amp;c. When the heart hath ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered any defilement, when it growes mouldy and muſty, there's no way to get the ill favour
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:38484:242"/>
out; but to bring it under the ſhine of Jeſus Chriſt. And then,</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>The Sunne hath an elevating vertue.</hi> By the heat and power of the Sunne are many things exhaled and lifted up from the earth, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe would lie there; many meteors and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions there are in the aire, which are exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from the earth by the power of the Sunne: Jeſus Chriſt hath an elevating vertue, he it is that doth exhale and lift up the earthly hearts of men to heavenly things and heavenly meditations. The heart of man naturally is ſo deep buried in the earth, that if Chriſt did not by his heat which he ſends down in his ordinances lift it up; it would never have one thought of heaven: he hath an attractive power to draw up the hearts of men to himſelfe, <hi>John</hi> 12. 32. It is from Jeſus Chriſt that ever you had one ſerious thought of heaven or heavenly things. The Apoſtle applies our ſpiritual raiſedneſſe to Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 1, 2. It is from Chriſt as the merit of it, and it is from him as the worker of it in us; the power of our ſpiritual reſurrection at firſt is from Chriſt, and the power of Chriſt is that that helps us to raiſe our ſelves higher from day to day; did not Chriſt ſend down his exhaling power, we ſhould lie like ſtones and never aſcend, he deſcends and then we aſcend.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>Chriſt is called the Sunne, to ſhew the cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Goſpel worſhip, in reſpect of the legal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation God uſed towards the Fathers.</hi> This is <hi>Calvins</hi> Note upon the text; God did never ſhine ſo clearly to the ſonnes of men in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Chriſt. The Ceremonial Law with all the appendixes thereof, was but dark: Goſpel worſhip is clear. The Apoſtle compares the Law
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:38484:242"/>
to a ſhadow, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 1. that was but Moon light or ſtar light, Goſpel worſhip is Sun-light, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 10. The Patriarchs ſaw Chriſt, and hoped in him, and were ſaved by him as well as we, but it was more darkly: In the Goſpel the heavens were opened wider then ever. God did never ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt himſelf ſo fully and clearly to the world as he hath done by Jeſus Chriſt. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of this <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 1. <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, Hence is that of the Prophet to the Goſpel-Church, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60. 1, 2. 19. 20. All former light was but like the dawning light of the morning in reſpect of this mid-day light of the Goſpel. The Goſpel Revelation is full, and perfect. <hi>John</hi> 1. 18. God was declared before, but never ſo fully as by Chriſt. The fathers looked for additions, but Chriſt brought to light the whole will of God: No further Revelation is to be expected till we come to heaven, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19.</p>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>He is their righteouſneſſe in regard of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi> It is thorough the Imputation of his righteouſneſs unto them, that they are made righteous in the ſight of God; God looking upon them as inveſted with the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, accounts them righteous. Of this the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 21, 22, 25, 26. All ar unrighteous in themſelves, and it is through him alone that they come to be righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>He is their righteouſneſſe in regard of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification.</hi> Of this the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. where he tells us, that <hi>Chriſt is made unto us, of God ſanctification,</hi> as well as righteouſneſſe; Jeſus Chriſt may be as truly called our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſanctification as well as of juſtification. He is ſo in four reſpects.</p>
            <p n="1">(1) <hi>He is the meritorious cauſe of it,</hi> Eph. 5. 25, 26. Grace is as truly the purchaſe of Chriſt as glory; he hath brought holineſſe for us, as well as heaven: ſanctification is no leſſe the price of Chriſts blood then ſalvation. We are 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 2. ſanctified in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>propter Chriſtum</hi> ſaith <hi>Piſcator,</hi> i. e. <hi>propter ſatisfactionem il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2) <hi>He is the material cauſe of it.</hi> It is by the blood of Chriſt that the filthineſſe of the ſoule is done away. Chriſts blood is the ſoules laver in which it is waſhed and made white, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. And then,</p>
            <p n="3">(3) <hi>He is the exemplary cauſe of it.</hi> Our ſanctification is according to that copy or pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:38484:244"/>
of holineſſe which is in Chriſt himſelfe. This is the meaning of that ſpeech of the Apoſtle, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 16. As the print which is made upon the wall anſwers the engraving or ſtamp which is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſeal; ſo doth the believers holineſſe anſwer our holineſſe of Chriſt, not in degree and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but in kinde and quality.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) <hi>He is the efficient cauſe of it.</hi> 'Tis Chriſt that doth by his ſpirit through the Ordinances work holineſſe in his Saints. He ſtubs up the roots of ſinne and ſets the routs of grace in the ſoul. Of this the Apoſtle ſpeaks 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11. And it is he that doth both preſerve it and carry it on from one degree to another til it come to perfection. So that both in regard of his own perſon and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his elect, he is called the Sunne of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>This is the ſecond particular. 3 For the third. Chriſt excels the natural Sun in theſe eight parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The natural Sunne ſhines but in one hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere at once.</hi> Though it circuit about the earth in a little time, y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t it doth not ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ne in all places at once. Yea there are ſome parts of the world in which the Sunne doth not ſhine for many moneths together. Though it be a great body, yet the wings of it are not large enough to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe the earth all at once, when it riſeth to us it ſets to our Antipodes, But now Jeſus Chriſt is able to ſhine over the whole earth at once. Though there be many parts of the world in which Chriſt hath never appeared, yet his wings are large enough to over-ſpread the whole earth. This Sunne of righteouſneſſe ſhines in <hi>England</hi> and in <hi>America</hi> and all the Chriſtian world o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver at the ſame moment of time. That which is
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:38484:244"/>
ſaid of the land of <hi>Judea</hi> concerning the King of <hi>Aſſyria, Eſa.</hi> 8. 8. <hi>That the ſtretching out of his wings ſhould fill the bredth of the land,</hi> is true of Chriſt in reference to the whole world; The ſtretchings out of his wings are able to cover the breadth of the whole world at one moment.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The naturall Sunne gives light but not ſight.</hi> If a man want the benefit of ſeeing, he hath no more benefit by the Sunne, in reſpect of ſeeing; then if there were no Sunne at all, but the Sunne-beames deſcend with never ſo much power upon a blind <hi>Bartimeus</hi> his eyes will not thereby be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened. But now this Sunne of righteouſneſſe hath a power to give ſight as well as light, he did in the dayes of his fleſh open the eyes of many that were naturally blinde you read of one, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. of two others, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 30. 34. And he doth ſtill open the eyes of them that are ſpiritually blinde. It was he that by <hi>Ananias</hi> opened the eyes of <hi>Saul,</hi> Acts 9. 17. The truth is, no man doth ever ſpiritually ſee till the beames of the Sunne deſcend upon him, he is the ſpiritual day-ſpring that gives them power to ſee who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of the groſſe darkneſſe of ſin and iniquity.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The natural Sunne hath endamaging qualities as well as healing qualities.</hi> It is many times of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive and prejudiced both to men and fruits.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) It doth fully and deface the beautiful countenance of men, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 6. If the eye of the Sunne do but look upon us directly, it chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es the colour of the face into a ſworthy hue.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) The hot beames of the Sunne do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by their vehement ſhining make men faint,
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:38484:245"/>
when the Sun beat upon the <hi>head of Jonah,</hi> he fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>Ch.</hi> 4. 8.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) The fruits of the earth are many times ſcorched and withered to nothing by the violent heat of the Sunne, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 6. If God do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the raine, and ſend out the burning heat of the Sunne, the fruits of the earth mourn and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh. But now Jeſus Chriſt the Sunne of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe hath no hurtful quality, his beames nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make the face black, nor the ſpirits faint. He ripens the fruits of grace in the ſoul, but he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver withers them, his beames are deſtructive to none but to ſuch as will not ſuffer him to ſhine upon them. Thoſe fruits that have no root, Chriſt withers, but where there is root and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>p, the beams of Chriſt are never prejudicial. The Sunne hath a hardning vertue, but Chriſt never hardens any, unleſſe it be by accident, becauſe they will not ſuffer his beames to enter into their hearts. 'Tis rather the want of Chriſts beames, then the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of them, that occaſions hardning in any heart.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The natural Sunne is the creature of this Sunne of righteouſneſſe.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt as he is God, made this Sunne that ſhines in the Firmament, and put into it all the glory which is in it. For the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt tells us, that <hi>all things were made by him, and without him was not made any thing that was made,</hi> Joh. 1. 3. He gave it both the light and heat which it gives to us. He hath ſet and appointed it the courſe which it runs, and which it hath run ſince its creation, and he doth by his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence order its ſetting and riſing for the good of the world. He is the light of all that light which the Sunne hath He is the fountain both of the being and preſervation of all that influence which
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:38484:245"/>
the Sunne doth cauſe to deſcend upon the world. The dependence of the Sunne of righteouſneſſe is upon himſelf, but the dependence of the natural Sunne is upon him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>The natural Sunne doth communicate his light and heat equally to all.</hi> He ſhines as much upon the houſe and lands of the wicked as he doth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the righteous. He doth impart and diſpenſe his influences alike to all, in the ſame manner and in the ſame meaſure. This our Saviour notes as an act of the bounty of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 45. But now it is not ſo with Jeſus Chriſt the Sunne of righteouſneſſe; He gives light and heat to one and not to another. Though all that live under the ſhining of the Ordinances do receive ſo much from Jeſus Chriſt as is ſufficient to leave them without excuſe, yet doth he cauſe peculiar beames to fall upon the hearts of ſome which do not fall upon another.</p>
            <p>He ſhines upon one only to conviction, on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to converſion. He ſhines only upon the eares of ſome; He lets down hot gleames into the very hearts of others, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6. We have an inſtance of this in <hi>Paul,</hi> and thoſe that were in company with him, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 6, 7. They ſaw the light, and heard a voice too, a confuſed voice which they did not underſtand, and therefore <hi>chap.</hi> 22. 9. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>they heard not the voice of him that ſpake.</hi> They heard an inarticulate ſound or a confuſed voice, but they knew neither who ſpake nor what was ſpoken, therefore they heard the voice, and yet heard it not; but now <hi>Paul</hi> both heard the voice and underſtood it, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by it, which we do not finde recorded of any of the reſt. Some common beames doth Chriſt caſt forth upon all, but his ſpecial beames
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:38484:246"/>
and influences are imparted to none but the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. Nor is this any derogation to the freeneſs of the grace of Chriſt, or to the fulneſſe of it. The fulneſſe and freeneſſe of grace conſiſts more in the greatneſſe of that he beſtowes, then in the multitude of them that enjoy what he gives them<hi>:</hi> Read of hidden <hi>Manna,</hi> of a white ſtone and a new name which Chriſt gives to ſome and not to others, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 17. This Sunne of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhines ſometimes on one in a houſe and leavs the reſt ſtill in darkneſſe.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>The natural Sunne is an inanimate thing.</hi> Though it be in ſome ſence called the fountaine of life, yet it is in it ſelf without life. It hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the rational, nor the ſenſitive, nor the vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive life. And in this reſpect the leaſt-living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is more glorious then the Sunne; a living dog is better then an inanimate jewel. But now Jeſus Chriſt is a living Sunne. This Sunne of righteouſneſſe hath life as well as light and heat, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 4. All that ſpiritual life which is in the ſoul is communicated from Chriſt, and preſerved by Chriſt, the ſoul is dead till it be imbreathened by Jeſus Chriſt. And hence it is that Chriſt is ſo often in Scripture called our life, as <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 3, 4. becauſe he gives and maintaines both the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and ſpiritual life. Yea the brighteſt beame the ſoul ever had from Chriſt here, is but a little glimpſe in reſpect of what ſhall be in heaven. There he ſhall ſhine.</p>

               </gap> the glorious Goſpel, or the Goſpel of glory, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 11. The Goſpel is exceeding full of glory; there's nothing in it but that which is very glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. This is enough to proclaim the glory of it, becauſe in it the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is diſcovered; the Goſpel is the Orbe in which the Sunne of righteouſneſſe ſhineth, it is the Chariot in which Chriſt rides. It is the Golden veſſel which carries this glorious light about the world. The Goſpel is the true <hi>Bethſhemeſh</hi> or houſe of the Sunne: it is called the Word of Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 16. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by this Word Jeſus Chriſt is diſcovered and manifeſted to the world. <hi>David</hi> doth admire the heavens for this, that in them God hath ſet a Tabernacle for the Sunne, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 4. The Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is that glorious Tabernacle which God hath ſet and eſtabliſhed for this great Sunne of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe. Where the Goſpel is not, Chriſt is not known, remove the Goſpel, and Chriſt the Sunne of righteouſneſſe is totally removed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The exceeding great glory of heaven.</hi> The Scripture makes mention of heaven as of a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous place. Amongſt other things this ſhewes the glory of it, that this Sunne of righteouſneſſe ſhines in it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 23. and 22. 3 This will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appear if we conſider how far Chriſts ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in heaven dazzels his ſhining here on earth. I will inſtance in theſe three particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In heaven Chriſt ſhines upon the ſoul immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately.</hi> There is nothing to interpoſe between Chriſt and the ſoul; his ſhinings in this life are immediate through the Ordinances, We ſee his
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:38484:247"/>
beames in this life through the thick glaſſe of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, the Churh tells us the manner of his ſhining in this life, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 9. We have his beames here only by reflection, but in heaven they are immediately darted down upon the ſoul. There is no Temple in heaven, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 22. Chriſt himſelfe is the Temple. Now if the mediate beamings of Chriſt upon the ſoul he ſo glorious? What abundant glory will there be in his imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate ſhinings!</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>In heaven he ſhines with his full ſtrength up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſoul.</hi> All have here on earth but ſmall beames of this Sunne; A beam in one Ordinance, and a beam in another, here a little and there a little, as we are able to bear it; the eye of the ſoul while it is unglorified, is not able without daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to look upon Jeſus Chriſt ſhining in his full ſtrength. <hi>Thou ſhalt ſee my back parts, but my face cannot be ſeen,</hi> Exod. 33. 22, 23. but in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the ſoul ſhall be able to take a full view of Chriſts face, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12.

            <p n="3">3. <hi>In heaven Chriſt ſhines without intermiſſion.</hi> The ſoul here doth often loſe the ſight of Chriſts face, every day is not a Sunne-ſhine day. There are ſome dark and gloomy dayes even to them that have the greateſt intereſt in Chriſt, <hi>Eſay</hi> 50. 10. but in heaven the Sunne is alwayes up. There are no clouds to Eclipſe the light of Chriſts face in that region. There's no night in heaven, <hi>Rev.</hi> 27. 25. That which cauſes the ſoul here to loſe the ſight of Chriſt ſhall not be in heaven. No ſinne enters into that holy place; if the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, perfect, uninterrupted ſhining of Chriſt can
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:38484:248"/>
make a place glorious, heaven is a moſt glorious place.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The miſerable condition of thoſe that have no intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> The Scripture makes it the top of all miſery to be without Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 12. This text beares witneſſe to it; How un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable would the world be if there were no Sunne? If God had not made the Sunne, the world would have been but an uncomfortable priſon. What a muſe and aſtoniſhment are men put into when the Sunne is Eclipſed but for a few houres? How doleful is their condition upon whom the Sunne of righteouſneſſe hath never ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen<hi>!</hi> They have neither ſpiritual light, nor ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual warmth, nor ſpiritual healing, nor ſpiritual ſoftneſſe that are without Chriſt. They want both the righteouſneſſe of juſtification, and of ſanctification that have not a ſaving intereſt in this Sunne of righteouſneſſe. There are no peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon the earth that ſtand in more need both of your compaſſions and prayers then thoſe that want Jeſus Chriſt. And they are ſo much the more miſerable, becauſe they want eyes to ſee their miſery.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>That there is no righteouſneſſe either of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication or ſanctification without Chriſt,</hi> he is called the Sunne of righteouſneſſe in both theſe reſpects, and therefore till he ariſe upon the ſoule, it hath no righteouſneſſe in either of theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>For the righteouſneſſe of juſtification.</hi> The Papiſts they teach and maintain that a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon muſt have in himſelf inherent righteouſneſſe to juſtifie him before Gods tribunall. They ſay that Chriſts righteouſneſſe is not the proper cauſe of juſtification, but that whereby God is pleaſed
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:38484:248"/>
to accept of the habits of righteouſneſſe in us, placing the matter of juſtification either in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing habitually inherent in us, or flowing from us. This Doctrine doth deveſt Jeſus Chriſt of this name which God hath here given him. He is called the <hi>Lord our righteouſneſſe,</hi> Jer. 23. 6. If he be our righteouſneſſe, then we are not our own righteouſneſſe. <hi>I would not be found,</hi> ſaith a good Divine, <hi>in the righteouſneſſe of the best prayers I ever made at the day of judgement.</hi> To take off men from this Popiſh doctrine, I ſhall lay down theſe Arguments againſt it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The righteouſneſſe of God and the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of man are oppoſed in Scripture as things incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſistent in the matter of juſtification,</hi> Phil. 3. 9. To mingle theſe two together, were to wear a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of linnen and woolen, which God forbade in his Law. He that ſubmits to the one cannot ſubmit to the other. So the Apoſtle teacheth us expreſly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3. he that truſts to the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of man cannot truſt to the righteouſ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of God. Our righteouſneſſe is that which we do in obedience to the Law, but Chriſts righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe is that by which we are reckoned righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the ſight of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>If righteouſneſſe be by workes then it is not of free grace but of due debt.</hi> This is the Apoſtles argument, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 6. The Papiſts anſwer this, by underſtanding, by works, there the works of nature and unregeneracy only, and not of works flowing from faith. But this is a meer falſhood; for the Apoſtle proves, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 2. that works flowing from faith cannot juſtifie before God. <hi>Abraham</hi> was regenerate, <hi>Abrahams</hi> works were works flowing from faith, yet were not thoſe works his righteouſneſſe but Chriſt apprehended by faith.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="480" facs="tcp:38484:249"/>
3. <hi>That righteouſneſſe by which and for which a perſon is juſtified muſt exactly anſwer Gods juſtice.</hi> It muſt be ſo every way perfect, that juſtice it ſelf can require no more, but the beſt of our works are imperfect and defective. They are ſo in our own ſight, much more in the ſight of God, <hi>Eſay</hi> 64. 6. Not only our righteouſneſſe, <hi>but our righteouſneſſes are a ſilthy ragge,</hi> Pſal. 130. 4. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was a man after Gods own heart, yet doth he acknowledge that if God ſhould <hi>weigh iniquity none ſhould ſtand. Job</hi> had a very high teſtimony from God, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 1. yet he durſt not ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch termes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. 3. 15. 20. 30, 31. <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi> did many good works, yet he comes to a <hi>Pſalme</hi> of mercy, <hi>chap.</hi> 13. 22.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>This Doctrine makes a man his own juſtifier,</hi> which is contrary to Scripture. The Scripture aſcribes the work of juſtification to God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 26. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 33. To make mans works the cauſe of his juſtification, is to make him a juſtifier, which is the work of God alone.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>This Doctrine make<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

To ſay it was needleſſe, is to make God cruel to his Sonne. Why ſhould he poure out his blood if there was no neceſſity of it?

               </gap>ient, is to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie his perſon, to contradict Scriptures which ſaith, he is able to ſave to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>This Doctrine eſtabliſheth boaſting.</hi> Now the great deſigne of God in the juſtification of a ſinner, is to exclude boaſting, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 27. The Law of works layes a foundation of boaſting, but the Law of faith excludes boaſting.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb facs="tcp:38484:249"/>
7. <hi>This Doctrine robs the ſoul of all conſolation, and leaves it unſetled and perplexed.</hi> A man can never be free from troubles that builds the hopes of his juſtification upon himſelf, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 6, 7. The ſcope of the Apoſtle in that place is to put a difference between the righteouſneſſe of the Law, and the righteouſneſſe of faith. Amongſt other this is one, the righteouſneſſe of faith ſettles the heart; it ſaith not, who ſhall aſcend, &amp;c? It knows Chriſt hath aſcended and deſcended, that he hath done all and ſuffered all, and ſo quiets the conſcience: He that truſts to his own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs can never be ſetled, but will be ſtill diſputing. And therefore the Papiſts who cry up juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by their own works, cry down aſſurance of ſalvation. And they cannot do otherwiſe, for juſtification by our own righteouſneſſe and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of ſalvation are inconſiſtent. Thus I have proved the righteouſneſs of juſtification to be from Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>For the righteouſneſſe of ſanctification.</hi> This is alſo from Chriſt, he that is without Chriſt, is without ſanctification. Till this Sunne be riſen upon the ſoul, there is no holineſſe in the ſoul. A Chriſtleſſe condition, is an unſanctified condition. A man muſt prove himſelf intereſted in Chriſt, before he can be able to aſſert his Sanctification; we are ſaid to be ſanctified in Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 2. you muſt thank Chriſt as well for the righteouſneſs of ſanctification, as for that of juſtification. Till theſe beames ſhine upon you, you have no grace in you.</p>

            <p n="1">1. To all men in general; I would recommend two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Bleſſe God for Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> We have great cauſe to bleſſe God for the light of the Sunne, innumerable are thoſe benefits we receive by this creature. 'Tis our guid, 'tis our life, by the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of it nature is revived, the body is cheered and all things uſefull for our life are refreſhed; the world had been an <hi>Egypt</hi> for <hi>darkneſſe,</hi> a <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe</hi> for <hi>barrenneſſe,</hi> an <hi>Hoſpital</hi> of <hi>diſeaſes;</hi> if God had not made the Sunne: the beauty of the creation would have been hid, the benefit of the creation would have been loſt if this lamp of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven had not been hung out<hi>:</hi> much more cauſe have we to bleſſe God for his myſtical Sunne, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 3. This will be the work of heaven to all eternity, had not this Sun from heaven viſited us, our condition had been as miſerable as the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of devils.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Never ſee the Sunne but meditate on Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> A ſpiritual Chriſtian may learn very much Divinity from the works of creation. Though the whole book of Creation without that revelation of the Goſpel could not have made Chriſt known to the world: the Phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers turn'd over every page of that great book, but they could ſpell nothing of Chriſt out of it; Yet now, we that have the Goſpel may help our knowledge of Chriſt by the book of creation. Chriſt is reſembled to ſo many creatures that we
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:38484:250"/>
can hardly ſee any creature, but it preacheth ſomething of him, when your eyes behold the light of the Sunne, when you feel the warmth of the Sunne, when you perceive the influential vertue of the Sunne upon the creatures, then think on Chriſt<hi>:</hi> the very Sun in the Firmament wil riſe up in judgment againſt us that have Chriſt revealed in the Goſpel as a Sunne, if we do not fill our hearts with daily thoughts of him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To them that are without the ſaving beams of Chriſt. I have onely one thing to preſſe upon them. <hi>That they would endeavour that this Sunne may ſhine upon them; yea, that it may ſhine into them</hi> be not contented to live without the Sunne. I know it will be ſaid, what ſhall we do that Chriſt may ariſe upon our hearts?</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Be ſenſible of your want of Chriſt,</hi> he that ſees and bewailes his own darkneſſe, will hardly dye without light. One reaſon why Chriſt doth not ſhine upon us, is, becauſe we think we have light in our ſelves, we think we ſaw Chriſt without the Sunne, therefore we are ſuffered to walk in blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs without the Sun.

            <p>Jeſus Chriſt is ſpiritual ointment. His Name both in the Hebrew and Greek ſignifies anointing, or anointed. He is called in <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 26. Meſſiah, which the Septuagint render <gap reason="foreign">

Oyle ſprung up and flowed for a day and a night together, our Annotatours mention it in their Expoſition of this text. The Oyles or Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments uſed in ſundry caſes under the ceremonial Law were ſome way or other typical of Chriſt the true ointment.</p>
            <p>In the handling of this Doctrine I ſhall open theſe foure things by way of Explication.</p>
            <p>1. In what reſpects Chriſt is compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ointment.</p>
            <p>2. Why he is compared to ointment poured forth.</p>
            <p>3. How this ointment is poured forth.</p>
            <p>4. How Chriſt excels all other oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the firſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Chriſt is ointment in regard of that divine uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wherewith he was anointed by God.</hi> The Scripture makes mention of Chriſts being anointed with the graces of the Spirit as our Mediator. This was typified by the anointing of the Prieſts under the Law, eſpecially of the high-Prieſt; you may read at large of the holy ointment, and of the anointing of <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſons with it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. 23, 24, 25, 30. It was alſo typified by the anointing of Kings and Prophets; ye may read much in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the anointing of theſe. <hi>Eliſha</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed to the office of a Prophet, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19. 16. and Kings were alſo anointed. We read of <hi>Davids</hi> anointing, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 1. of <hi>Solomons</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 1. 34. 39. All theſe were types of Chriſt, the great King, Prophet, and Prieſt of his Church, the anointing Oyle did typifie the
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:38484:254"/>
graces of the Spirit, the anointing of <hi>Aaron</hi> with that Oyle did typifie Chriſts anointing with the Holy Ghoſt. Our Saviour was anointed with the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Eſay</hi> 61. 1. This <hi>Peter</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in his Sermon, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 38. <hi>God anointed Jeſus of Nazareth</hi> with the Holy Ghoſt and with power. Now this ointment was ſhed upon the Lord Jeſus in ſuch great plenty, that he may well be called by the name of ointment, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 7. he had more of this ſpirituall ointment poured upon his humane nature, then all the Saints, put them altogether. The Spirit was not given him by meaſure, but above meaſure, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 34. He was from his conception filled with the holy Ghoſt; He was full of grace and truth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 14. He had not only drops, but whole rivers of Oyle poured upon his head; He may be denominated ointment from that abundance of ſpiritual oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wherewith he was filled; his God-head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed the manhood with an unſpeakable ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 19. And,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Chriſt is ointment in regard of the excellent vertues which are in him.</hi> He hath all the good properties of ointment. I name five, As</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Oyntment is very fragrant and odoriferous.</hi> Precious oyntment yeilds a very ſweet ſmall. When the woman in the Goſpel had poured her box of oyntment upon the head of Chriſt, the text ſaith, <hi>the whole houſe was filled with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of it,</hi> John 12. 3. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt is very odoriferous, he is ſweet in himſelf, and he is exceeding ſweet in the noſtrils of his Saints; the perfume in the Law was type of him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30 34. He doth perfume all perſons and places where ever he comes. If there be but one drop of Chriſt poured upon the ſoul, the whole ſoul
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:38484:254"/>
is perfumed with the ſmell of it. When Chriſt had but put his finger into the hole of the door, how was the hand of the Spouſe perfumed as with ſweet ſmelling myrrh! <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 5. That ſoul wants its ſpiritual ſmelling which doth not finde a ſweetneſſe in Jeſus Chriſt. Every thing in Jeſus Chriſt is very fragrant.</p>
            <p n="1">(1) <hi>There is a fragrancy in his perſon. He is a bundle of precious myrrh,</hi> Cant. 1. 13. His life and holy converſation yeilded a ſweet ſmell in the world, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 8. <hi>All thy garments ſmell of myrrh, aloes and caſſia.</hi> The graces of the Spirit, of which his life was full: His righteouſneſſe, meekneſſe, piety, patience, what a ſweet ſmell do they caſt abroad in the Goſpel to this very day!</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) There is fragrancy in his death. His death was a ſweet favour unto God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 2. His dead body was enbalmed with ſweet ſpices, <hi>John</hi> 19. 39. not that he had need of any ſuch; His body did never ſee corruption, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 10. So fragrant was the death of Chriſt, that he hath perfumed the grave, and made it as a bed of roſes to all the Saints.</p>
            <p n="3">(3) <hi>There is a ſweet fragrancy in his interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> The interceſſion of Chriſt is ſo ſweet, that it perfumes heaven it ſelf. See how it was ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified under the Law, <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. 12, 13. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours of the ſweeteſt incenſe are not ſo fragrant to the noſtrils of men, as the odours of Chriſts interceſſion are to God. So fragrant is his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion, that the ſervices of his people, which are unſavory in themſelves, come up as a cloud of incenſe before the Lord. See this <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. 6. It's ſpoken of the Church becauſe it's the femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine gender, <hi>Quae iſta?</hi> All this ſweetneſſe
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:38484:255"/>
which is upon the Church and in her ſervices, is, becauſe they are perfumed with the incenſe of Chriſts mediation.</p>
            <p n="4">(4) <hi>There is a fragrancy in the word of Chriſt.</hi> The breath of Chriſts mouth is ſweeter then any perfume in the world<hi>:</hi> this is that which the Church mentions. <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 16. His mouth or palate is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>ſweetneſſes,</hi> ſo it is in the original; all his promiſes, all his precepts are very favoury.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>There is a fragrancy in all his Ordinances,</hi> Prayer, Sacraments, Preaching, ſinging of Pſalmes are in themſelves, and to a gracious heart, like ſweet ſmelling oyntment. The Church mentions this, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 3. No ſuch ſweet aire bloweth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heaven as doth in the Church of God, where the Ordinances of Chriſt are diſpenſed in power and purity. In one word, there is nothing of Chriſt but is more ſweet then the beſt oyntment that ever was compounded by man. This is the firſt property of oyntment, it's very ſweet.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Oyntment hath an exhilarating vertue.</hi> It cheeres the ſpirits, and makes the heart glad. This is obſerved by <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 27. 9. <hi>Oyntment and perfume rejoyce the heart.</hi> When <hi>Solomon</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts men to a cheerful life, he makes mention of oyntment, let thy head want no ointment, alluding to the cuſtome of the ancients, who in their banquettings and feaſtings uſed ſuch ſignes of joy. And the Prophet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the jovialty of thoſe Epicures, <hi>Amos</hi> 6. 6. ſaith, <hi>they anoint themſelves with the chief oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> The Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath a cheering vertue. The heart of a ſinner is never truly mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, till it be anointed with the graces of Chriſt, and the comforts of Chriſt; Chriſt is the
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:38484:255"/>
onely remover of ſpiritual heavineſſe. The oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the onely cure for ſpiritual melancholy, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 28. All ſpiritual refreſhing is from Jeſus Chriſt. He was anointed with the oyle of gladneſſe, that he might work gladneſſe in the hearts of others. This work is committed to him by God the Father, <hi>Eſay</hi> 61. 3. There's not one drop of the oyle of joy, but what comes out of this great olive tree, the Lord Jeſus; that gladneſſe which doth not proceed from Chriſt, and which is not bottom'd on Chriſt, is world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly madneſſe, not true joy. He is called the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Luke 2. 25. He hath laid the foundation of <hi>Iſraels</hi> comfort, and he it is that doth convey to them all their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>Oyntment hath a mollifying and ſuppling ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> If there be any hard tumour or ſwelling upon the body, we uſe oyntment to ſoften it. The holy Ghoſt alludes to this, <hi>Eſay</hi> 1, 6. Where ſpeaking of the ſtate diſeaſes, he ſaith, <hi>they have not been mollified with oyntments.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt hath a mollifying vertue, let a heart of Adamant be but once anointed with this oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and it becomes an heart of fleſh. It was by this oyntment that the hard heart of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſeh</hi> was ſoftned. God by his Spirit chafed this oyntment into it, and it became tender. And it is by the Application of this unction through the warm hands of the Spirit of God that the ſtony hearts of ſinners are ſoftened from day to day. Thou that haſt now a tender heart, wouldeſt have carried thy ſtony heart with thee to thy grave, if this precious oyntment had not been ſpread upon it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Oyntment is of a ſhining nature.</hi> It hath a
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:38484:256"/>
brightning and beautifying vertue. Thoſe Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins that were prepared for the <hi>Perſian</hi> King, did uſe divers oyntments to make themſelves beautiful. <hi>Eſt.</hi> 2. 12. they uſed ſix moneths ſweet odours, and ſix moneths oyle of myrrh. This oyle, as thoſe that write of it ſay, had an abſterſive vertue; it did help to get wrinkles out of the skin, and ſo to beautifie the face and make it bright; <hi>Naomi</hi> therefore bids <hi>Ruth,</hi> when ſhe ſends her to <hi>Boaz</hi> to anoint her ſelf, <hi>Ruth</hi> 3. 3. And <hi>David,</hi> ſpeaking of oyle, ſaith, it <hi>makes the face to ſhine, Pſal.</hi> 104. 15. Warriors of old, that they might make their armour gliſter, and ſo render themſelves formidable to their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, uſed to anoint them with oyle; the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet alludes to this, <hi>Eſay</hi> 21. 5. <hi>Ariſe ye Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and anoint the ſhield.</hi> The Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath a brightning vertue. As he is bright and beautiful in his own perſon, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

All the wrinkles of ſinne, all the ſpots of the ſoul are done away by means of this oyntment. This oyntment, if it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Jeſus Chriſt is the Churches Golden a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing-pot; he that would have his ſpots re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, muſt daily drop this ointment upon his ſoul. This ointment if it be applyed by faith will fetch off the red ſpots of cruelty, the black ſpots of diſcontent, the blew ſpots of envy, the heat ſpots of paſſion; it will put a ſhining luſter upon the ſoul.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Ointment hath a healing vertue,</hi> the <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan</hi> poured into the wounded man <hi>wine and oile,</hi> Luk. 10. 34. Wine for cleanſing and Oile for healing; your Chyrurgions make much uſe of ointment ſearch the Diſpenſatory for the truth of this; Jeſus Chriſt hath a healing vertue. If the ſpiritual wounds of the ſoul, though they have been of long continuance, be anointed with this ointment, they are in a ſhort time finely healed. Chriſt himſelf was that Samaritan, his blood was the wine that cleanſed, and the Oile that healed thoſe deſperate wounds. There is no other <hi>balme in Gilead</hi> beſides this ointment that can cure the leaſt ſore upon the inward man, without the application of this ointment you will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dye in your ſins.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For the ſecond. Chriſt is compared to ointment poured forth, in three reſpects.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>To ſhew his communicativeneſſe,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt is ready to make diſtributions unto his people of all that grace and goodneſſe which is in him, he doth not keep his grace and vertue within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:38484:257"/>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of ointment ſtands continually open that his Elect may take out of it according as they ſtand in need; the ointment which was poured upon the head of <hi>Aaron</hi> at his Conſecration, <hi>ran down to the very skirts of his cloathing,</hi> Pſal. 133. 2. This was to typifie the communicativeneſſe of Chriſt. Jeſus Chriſt hath received the ointment of the Spirit, not for himſelf, but that he might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint al his members; and he is very mindful of the truſt repoſed in h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>m; he received for his members, and he is willing they ſhould receive from him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 6. Many are willing to have the patrimony of others poured into their treaſury, but they care not to poure out againe; but Chriſt, as he was willing God ſhould poure out grace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, ſo is he as willing to poure it out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us.</p>

Secondly, particularly.</p>
            <p>Firſt, from the fragrancy of Chriſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> may learne four thing.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>How unſavoury they are that want Chriſt.</hi> Wicked men have <hi>animam pro ſal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> their ſoules keep their bodies ſweet, but what have they then to keep their ſoules ſweet? the holy Ghoſt compares men that are in the ſtate of nature to that which is moſt unſavory, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14. 3. They are unſavory both in their perſons and in ſervices, that want this oyntment. A heart unanointed caſts the worſt ſmell of any corrupt thing in the world.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Acknowledge from whence it is that all your fragrancy proceeds.</hi> If there be any good ſmell upon your ſouls, it is becauſe this oyntment hath been poured forth upon you. Jeſus Chriſt mentions the ſweet ſmell of his Spouſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4 10, 11. and indeed every beleever is a ſweet ſavour unto God. The precious oyntment of the graces of Chriſt poured upon your head at your converſion, is the onely reaſon of this good ſavour; 'tis great pride and ingratitude not to own it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>This teacheth us all how to make and keep the ſoul ſweet.</hi> Satan labours to make it muſty by breathing the ill ayre of ſinne into it, and if you would have it ſmell ſweetly, you muſt anoint it with this oyntment every day. Drop but every day a drop of this oyntment upon it by prayer, meditation, or ſome other holy duty, and it will preſerved ſweet notwithſtanding the thick fogs of ſinne and temptation. Carry Chriſt in your boſome, and you will ſmell very ſweet in every company.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="506" facs="tcp:38484:262"/>
4. <hi>When ever you ſmell any ſweet ſavour, think on Chriſt.</hi> The beſt uſe which we can make of perfumes and oyntments, is to make them remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancers to put us in mind of him who perfumes both earth and heaven. And then,</p>
            <p>Secondly, from the cheering vertue of this oyntment, learne two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Whither to go for heart reviving.</hi> When you finde your ſpirits dull and melancholy, when your hearts are tired out, and your ſouls languiſh, ſmell to this precious oyntment, and it will revive you. It's Chriſts work to revive the ſpirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite. The ſmell of the oyntment, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Chriſts ſatisfaction, or of his promiſes, or of his interceſſion is the ſpeedieſt and ſureſt way to be rid from the power of ſpiritual heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Let them that have this oyntment, maintaine ſpiritual cheerfulneſſe.</hi> God calls for ſpiritual gladneſſe, as well as ſpiritual ſorrow, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 1. A well grounded cheerfulneſſe, honours religion as much as holineſſe. The Scripture was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for conſolation, as well as for converſion, <hi>John</hi> 15. 11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 4. The Spirit is a comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as well as a ſanctifier, <hi>John</hi> 15. 26. You that have this oyntment, maintaine a holy light-heartedneſſe. There is a vaine mirth, and there is a ſinful and ſenſual mirth, avoid theſe, but the holy mirth muſt be kept up. Its a diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to the holy oyntment, to ſee anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ones droop in the blackeſt ſeaſons. And then,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, from the mollifying vertue of this oyntment, learn two things,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="507" facs="tcp:38484:262"/>
1. <hi>The Scripture remedy against hardneſſe of heart.</hi> It's a diſeaſe the beſt are troubled; with leſſe or more; chafe this ſuppling oyntment <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap>l hardneſſe of the ſoul.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Aſcribe all heart ſoftneſſe to Chriſt.</hi> Had not this ſuppling oyntment d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>opt upon it, it had been ſtony to this preſent day.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, from the beautifying vertue of this oyntment, learn two things,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>What true beauty is.</hi> To be anointed with Chriſt, to be filled with his graces, to be made partaker of the divine nature, this is beauty, this is true beauty, this is laſting beauty, this is beauty that will commend us to God. 'Tis not he that hath the beautiful face, but he that hath the beautiful ſoule, that is accepted of God. And then,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>He that would be beautiful, let him anoint himſelf with Chriſt.</hi> How vaine are perſons in painting their faces? <hi>Jezabels</hi> daughters abound, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 9. 30. as if they would mend Gods work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, it was formerly whores cuſtomes, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 23. 40. Anoint your ſelves once with this oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and all others will be unpleaſant. And then,</p>
            <p>Fifthly, from the healing quality of this oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, learn two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>To acknowledge how their ſores were healed.</hi> Thou waſt one full of wounds, now they are bound up and healed. Thou mayeſt bleſſe God for this balſome of heaven, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Get this oyntment into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               </gap>, eſpecially were they are farre from Chirurgion. All our houſes by reaſon of ſin are no better then ſpiritual hoſpitals. There's no balme in <hi>Gilead</hi> that can heal one ſore, but this divine balm, Jeſus Chriſt; get your veſſels fill'd with this oyntment, and all will be well; pray that God would poure this oyntment into your wounded children and ſervants, elſe they are but dead men.</p>

            <p>Firſt, in reference to the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> beleevers are like the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in three reſpects.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In regard of their inward circumciſion.</hi> It was the badge of an <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> and that whereby he was diſtinguiſhed from all other Nations, that he was circumciſed. Other Nations are
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:38484:265"/>
called uncircumciſion, the Iſraelites are called ordinarily <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he circumciſion. Beleevers, they and they onely are ſpiritually <hi>circumciſed;</hi> the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skin of their fleſh is mortified and cut off, they are circumciſed with the <hi>circumciſion not made with hands. Col.</hi> 2. 11. The body of ſinne is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mortified in them; Hence they are called in Scripture the circumciſion as the Iſraelites were, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 3. <hi>We are the circumciſion,</hi> ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, ſpeaking of beleevers, <hi>which worſhip God in the Spirit,</hi> a true Beleever is a true circumciſed perſon.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>In regard of the Law written in their hearts.</hi> It was the great priviledge of the people of Iſrael that they had the Law of God amongſt them. The Apoſtle mentions this, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 2. And the Prophet <hi>David</hi> long before him, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 147. 19. Beleevers have this priviledge above all people under heaven, that the Law of God is with them, nay the Law of God is in them; not the Law of nature, but the Law of grace; it is not onely written amongſt them, but it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in them. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of this, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>In regard of their neerneſſe to God.</hi> It was the great dignity of the people of Iſrael, that they were of all people neereſt to God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 7. They were Gods heritage, his peculiar people, ſeparated from all people under heaven. It is the great priviledge of beleevers, that they are neerer to God then all other people. They are neer to God in affection, they are neer to God in relation. Of this the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 13. Thus they are called <hi>the Iſrael of God,</hi> in regard of the people of Iſrael.</p>

Secondly, in reference to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>rael. Iſrael</hi> is <hi>Jacob,</hi> he had that name <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> that,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In regard of their godly ſimplicity.</hi> It was the commendation of <hi>Jacob,</hi> that he was a plain man, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25. 27. It relates not ſo much to his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward condition, as to the inward frame of his heart. Beleevers are a ſingle hearted generation: That which our Saviour ſaith of <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> is true of them, at leaſt in deſire and affection; they are not only <hi>without gall,</hi> but even <hi>without guile,</hi> John 1. 47. they ſtudy plainneſſe rather then greatneſſe, they put away deceit far from their Tabernacles.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>In regard of their holy zeal. Jacob</hi> was a man full of the fire of heavenly zeal. How ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt was he in reforming his family? <hi>Gen</hi> 35. 2, 3. Here is true zeal, it begins reformation at home; all true beleevers have ſparks of this coeleſtial fire in their boſomes, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 14. They deſire that they and theirs may be reformed, who ever walk diſorderly. They reſolve as <hi>Joſhuah, I and my houſe will ſerve the Lord,</hi> Joſhuah 24. 15.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>In regard of their wrestlings with God. Jacob</hi> had the Name of <hi>Iſrael</hi> given him, becauſe of his violent wreſtlings with God by prayer, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 28. The Prophet doth fully interpret what this wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtling was, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 12. 3, 4. His prayers and teares were the two armes by which he wreſtled with God. Every true beleever is frequent in this exerciſe. <hi>I give my ſelf to prayer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

The Scripture makes mention of many grounds of ſpiritual conſolation. To inſtance ſome particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Reconciliation with God.</hi> There can be no true comfort till God and the ſinner be made one. Reconciliation is the firſt bottom of Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 2. The begining of his Prodigals joy was the reconciliation of his father to him, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. latter end. Now the Scripture tells us, that reconciliation is the purchaſe of Chriſts blood; he is the only atonement of the ſoule, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 21, 22. There had never been any pacifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between heaven and earth, if Jeſus Chriſt had not interpoſed himſelf. He was contented that the Father ſhould make war with him, that his fury towards us might ceaſe. He is our peace-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by whom we have peace with God and with our ſelves.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The work of grace in the heart.</hi> Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is one ground of conſolation. <hi>The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God is righteouſneſſe, and peace, and joy in the holy Ghoſt,</hi> Rom. 14. 17. That comfort which is true, is builded upon righteouſneſſe. <hi>The ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of righteouſneſſe ſhall be peace, and the fruit of</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:38484:266"/>
               <hi>righteouſneſſe, quietneſſe, and aſſurance for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> Eſay 32. 17. Now all our holineſſe and grace is the purchaſe of Jeſus Chriſt. The ſhedding of his blood doth not onely procure for us glory hereafter but grace here. The conſcience is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by the ſtreames of his blood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. He is as properly our ſanctification as our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The pardon of ſinne.</hi> Remiſſion is an inlet of Conſolation, <hi>Eſay</hi> 40. 1, 2. <hi>Comfort ye, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort ye my people, tell them that their iniquity is forgiven.</hi> Sence of pardon is the true ground of ſpiritual laughter. Our Saviours uſual receipt for the working of comfort is this, <hi>Be of good cheer, thy ſinnes are forgiven.</hi> So he ſaith to the para<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ytick, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 2. the heart may be light in heavineſſe when ſinne is once remitted. Now we know Chriſts blood is the meritorious cauſe of the remiſſion of ſinne. 'Tis he that hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piated our ſinnes, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 13, 14. He that will be forgiven any other way, ſhall never be forgiven; His blood is the onely bath for the waſhing away of ſin, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 7.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Right to the promiſes.</hi> The promiſes of the Goſpel are the wells of true Comfort. The Apoſtle makes mention of the comfort of the Scriptures, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 4. If there be any <hi>comfort in the Scriptures,</hi> it is in the <hi>promiſes.</hi> Precepts are written for direction; threatnings for ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; promiſes chiefly for conſolation. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet mentions the <hi>breaſts of the Churches conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, Eſay</hi> 66. 11. The promiſes of the Goſpel are the <hi>breaſts of the Churches conſolation,</hi> by ſucking at theſe breaſts the heart is made glad. Now, who but Chriſt purchaſed the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes? The Apoſtle ſaith, that all the promiſes of
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:38484:267"/>
God are in Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 20. They are in him as the procuring and meritorious cauſe of them all. The Covenant of grace which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a bundle of rich promiſes, is the purchaſe of Chriſts blood. The world had never heard of a promiſe of any good, if it had not been for Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Hope of ſalvation.</hi> Hope is the door of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation. We rejoyce in the hope of the glory of God, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 2. There's more cauſe of rejoycing in this, then in being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to caſt out devils, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 20 Now we know that it was none but Jeſus Chriſt that did or could unlock the way to heaven. He is the way to heaven, He is the purchaſer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>f heaven. God hath given us eternal life, and this life is in his Sonne, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 11. He is called the ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God in this ſong, <hi>v.</hi>

               </gap>0. There would have been no entrance for any of <hi>Adams</hi> loſt ſeed into glory, if Chriſt had not ſet the door open; it is be that opened the Kingdome of heaven to all beleevers.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>The gift of the Spirit.</hi> The holy Ghoſt is called the <hi>Comforter</hi> John 14. 26. His office is to work conſolation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>he hearts of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Spiritual comfort is therefore called joy in the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 17. becauſe the holy Ghoſt doth create it in the ſoul. Now we know the in-dwelling of the holy Ghoſt in us is the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 15. 26. <hi>When the comforter is come, whom I will ſend unto you from the Father.</hi> The third perſon had never been our comforter, if the ſecond perſon had not been our Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. There is nothing can be thought on which hath any cauſality or efficiency in our conſolation, but it is of Chriſts procurement. This is the firſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:38484:267"/>
Secondly, <hi>By way of conveyance.</hi> As all our grace is communicated and conveyed unto us from Chriſt, ſo is alſo our conſolation. Jeſus Chriſt doth by his Spirit in the Ordinances of grace actually convey comfort unto his people as he ſees them ſtand in need of it. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaks of the beleevers conſolation abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 5. All comfort is in Chriſt as a fountaine; in him God hath put it for all his members, and from him it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to them according to their neceſſity. As we receive out of his <hi>fulneſſe grace for grace,</hi> ſo we receive out of his fulneſſe conſolation for conſolation; that is one drop, one ſtreame after another in a ſweet ſucceſſion. He that hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed our comfort keeps our comfort, and doth ſeaſonably adminiſter to us according to the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences of our ſouls.</p>
            <p n="3">3. For the third; That he is the conſolation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> onely. As he alone is the conſolation of his people, ſo is he the conſolation of his people alone. None but beleevers have a ground of actual comfort in Chriſt This may be evinced by a threefold Argument.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Scripture makes conſolation to be the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge onely of ſuch.</hi> Eſay 40. 1. <hi>Comfort ye, comfort ye my people,</hi> ſaith their God. The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt in the holding out of comfort, are confined and determined onely to the people of God. The whole current of Scripture runs this way. <hi>Eſay</hi> 65. 13, 14. Conſolation is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per onely to them that are ſanctified by grace.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>None but they have any actual intereſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Chriſts merit, or interceſſion, or any of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits.</hi>
               <pb n="518" facs="tcp:38484:268"/>
None but the beleever can ſay, Chriſt died for me; none but the beleever can ſay, Chriſt intercedes for me; both his ſatisfaction and interceſſion are confined to them, <hi>John</hi> 17. 9. 19. 'Tis true, the Elect that are unconverted have benefit in Chriſts Mediatorſhip, by vertue of which they ſhall in time be brought in to God; but as to actual Application, none but the true <hi>Iſraelite</hi> hath intereſt. Chriſt is actually the portion of none but the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is terror to all unbeleevers,</hi> not in himſelf, but becauſe they reject him. He that is the ſalvation of the beleever, is accidental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the dam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion of the unbeleever, becauſe he refuſeth him. <hi>John</hi> 3. 18. It will be the greateſt condemnation of the wicked another day, that there was a Chriſt, and they would none of him; he is to the unbeleever <hi>a ſtone of ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and rock of offe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This childe is ſet for the fall and riſing again of many in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Chriſt that is ſet for the riſing of the true <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, is ſet alſo for the falling of the carnal Iſraelites; the condemnation of the unbeleever would have been more eaſie if Chriſt had never been. Thus much for Explication.</p>
            <p>The Uſes of this, are Information. Exhortation. Conſolation.</p>

1. <hi>The common bulk of the Jews did expect Chriſt onely for external advantages.</hi> They expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted him onely as one that ſhould reſtore their outward liberties, which were now invaded and taken away; but <hi>Simeon</hi> waited for him as a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Redeemer, that ſhould ſave their ſouls from ſin and hell.</p>

            </p>
            <p>There is a two fold haſtening of a promiſed good.</p>
            <p>The one ariſing from impatience.</p>
            <p>The other ariſing from deſire; now though waiters muſt not haſten any good with a haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of impa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ience, yet they may, and muſt haſten it with a haſtening of deſire. To haſten any good which God hath promiſed, out of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, argues diſtruſt of God; but not to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten out of ardent deſires, argues ſome ſleighting of the good promiſed. I <hi>have longed for thy ſalvation, O Lord,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119. 174. Longing is the very height and extremity of deſire. A waiter may not be a limiter of God, but he may be a p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>titioner unto God for the fulfilling of his promiſe. The Scripture expreſſeth waiting by a word which ſignifies heat of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, <hi>Rom</hi> 8. 19. <hi>The earneſt expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifeſtation of the Sonnes of God.</hi>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the word ſignifies wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or looking with a ſtretched out neck. As a priſoner looks for an expected pardon, or as a man looks for a friend, whom he hath long expected and would gladly ſee.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="534" facs="tcp:38484:276"/>
This vehement deſire for the fulfilling of the promiſe is to be expreſſed,</p>
            <p n="1">(1) <hi>By frequent muſings and meditations.</hi> The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oul muſt have its thoughts much upon the promiſe. What <hi>David</hi> ſaith of the Precepts of God, that <hi>they are alwayes before him,</hi> ſo we muſt ſay, and ſo muſt we do with the promiſes of God, they muſt be ever before us, we muſt meditate on them all the day long.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) <hi>By <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ervent prayer.</hi> Patience in waiting for a promiſe, and paſſionate earneſtneſſe in praying for the fulfilling of it are not incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent. We muſt daily beg of God that he would give being to his promiſes. We muſt ſay with the Church, <hi>Come away my beloved, &amp;c.</hi> Cant. 8. <hi>ult.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">(3) <hi>By careful uſe of all lawful means to make good the condition of the promiſe.</hi> We muſt be as earneſt to do what God hath commanded, as to enjoy the good which God hath promiſed. This is the firſt particular.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For the ſecond. Why godly men do thus wait for the good which God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed. I ſhall name a ſeven-fold Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>They know their ſelves to be ſervants.</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants muſt wait upon their Maſters for the good they expect <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>3. 2. The people of God know they are but ſervants, and ſervants that do depend upon the free will of God for every thing; this makes them willing to wait on God. He that will not wait on God, denies himſelf to be a ſervant, and denies God to be his Maſter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:38484:276"/>
Secondly, <hi>They know God hath given the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> both faith and hope for this purpoſe, that they may wait on him.</hi> Waiting is nothing elſe but the acting of hope. A childe of God would not have any grace lie idle in his ſoule. He knows God hath given every grace for exerciſe. Not to employ and act grace received, is to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe grace received. A childe of God would not abu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>nt as hope is. Now he knows that hope is given to enable him to waite for the fulfilling of promiſes, <hi>Ergo.</hi> And,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>They know in ſome meaſure what a great ſinne it is not to wait.</hi> To refuſe to wait on God for the fulfilling of his promiſe, is to ſlight God, to undervalue the promiſe as if there were nothing in it worth our waiting for. A man cannot lightly diſparage either God or his promiſes more profeſſedly then by refuſing to wait on him for his promiſes. Now a child of God would not willingly caſt any reproach either on God or his promiſes from which he receives ſo much good, <hi>Ergo.</hi> And then.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>They are not unmindful how long, and with how much patience God waited on them for their obedience.</hi> They remember God tarried Sermon after Sermon, year after year for their converſion. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of Gods long-ſuffering in waiting on the old world, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 20. Every one of Gods children are ſenſible of Gods patient waiting on them when they had no minde to know him. When they ſlighted grace, when they ſcorned mercy, God waited; this makes them ſo ready to waite on God, <hi>Eſay</hi> 30 18. And then.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>Their own undeſerving of the good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.</hi>
               <pb n="536" facs="tcp:38484:277"/>
The children of God know that all Gods promiſes are free as to them. <hi>Jacobs</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement will be readily aſſented unto by them, <hi>Gon.</hi> 32. 10. They know how well they deſerve the heavieſt threatning, but how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy they are of the leaſt mercy. They do with an unfeigned heart, ſay as <hi>David</hi> did, when God had promiſed him to build his houſe, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 18. <hi>Who am I, O Lord God, and what is my houſe that thou haſt brought me hitherto.</hi> A childe of Gods Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>to is. <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſſe then the least of all the mercies of God.</hi> This makes them wait. And,</p>
            <p>Sixthly, <hi>They know how certain the promiſes of God are.</hi> They have had experience how he hath made good the promiſes that are paſt, and they know he will ſhew the ſame unchangeableneſſe in thoſe that are to come. They know his Name is Jehovah. God that hath his own being from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and that will give being to all his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. This encourages them to wait. It was the Apoſtles Logick in their generation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 10. It is ignorance of God that cauſes the heart to diſtruſt. <hi>They that know thy Name,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, will put their trust in thee,</hi> Pſal. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 10. Gods children know his Name, therefore they will wait. And,</p>
            <p>Seventhly, <hi>The ſatisfaction they expect from the enjoyment of what is promiſed.</hi> They know e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very promiſe of God will bring <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ull content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of heart when it is fulfilled. They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not now expect ſo much as they ſhall then finde in the promiſes of God. They know they are, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of them in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>Exceeding great and precious promiſes.</hi> They know the harveſt will make amends for all
<pb facs="tcp:38484:277"/>
their expectation, therefore they wait for it.</p>
            <p>The Uſes are for 1. Information. 2. Reprehenſion. 3. Exhortation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For information. This teacheth us three leſſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That Godly men have a very good opinion of God.</hi> They dare take his Word for that which they love with the deareſt affection. They are willing to wait the whole time of their life for the accompliſhment of that good which he hath promiſed. As they dare follow God when they know not whether he will carry them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11 8. ſo they dare wait on God, when they ſee no reaſon for their waiting. Did they not bear a ſingular affection to him, they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with ſo much ſatisfaction waite upon him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The excellency of grace.</hi> Grace is a choice thing in it ſelf, and its choice in its effects. This is one excellent effect of grace, that it doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able the ſoul to wait on God for things that are moſt difficult to be brought to paſſe. Corrup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion teacheth the heart to wrangle with God, but grace teacheth the heart to waite on God. A gracious ſpirit is a choice ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That faith doth not only look to things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but to future things.</hi> Senſe onely mindes things preſent, but faith mindes things that are a great way off, <hi>Heb</hi> 11. 1. It is as willing to wait on God for a future good, as it is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a preſent good. Faith hath an Eagles eye, and a Lions heart. It hath a Lions heart to
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:38484:278"/>
bear preſent evils, and it hath an Eagles eye to ſee future good. It's ſaid of the Patriarchs, <note place="margin">

            <p n="2">2. For reprehenſion. To thoſe that will not wait for the fulfilling of Gods promiſes. Theſe are of two ſorts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Such as are over-haſty, that would have the promiſe fulfilled before its time. And then,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Such as never minde the promiſes of God, look no more after them then if they had never been made. <hi>Simeons</hi> practice blames both theſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>For thoſe that would anticipate God in his promiſes.</hi> They are ſo eager for the fulfilling of the promiſes, that they would have them accompliſhed before their time. I would deſire ſuch men to conſider theſe three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>This is a very ſinful frame of heart.</hi> What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be pretended as an excuſe or extenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it cannot be denyed but the ſinne is great to be over eager with God to give being to his promiſe before the time. Conſider five parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
            <p n="1">(1) <hi>'Tis an implicite denyal of Gods right to appoint his own time.</hi> The Scripture puts times and ſeaſons, as well as things and perſons under the juriſdiction of God.

Men that are free, will not be limited; much more unfit is it that God ſhould be limitted. To limit God, is to exalt our ſelves above God, as if we were wiſer then he.

The ſoul that would have the promiſe brought to paſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore its time, doth in effect ſay, God hath not choſen the beſt time. Now to diſparage Gods choice, is a great ſinne. He that ſaith any thing might have been done after a better manner, or in a better time then that wherein God hath done it, doth deny God to be God onely wiſe. Thus you ſee the ſinne is great in being too haſty with God, I might adde one thing more.</p>
            <p n="5">(5) <hi>'Tis a denyal of our ſelves to be beggars.</hi> We ſay beggars muſt not be chuſers. To be two haſty to have promiſes made good, is as if we ſhould ſay Gods promiſes are not acts of grace, but due debts. This is the firſt Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

Our willingneſſe to wait for a promiſe ſhall not keep us without it one hour longer, our impatience ſhall not produce it one moment ſooner then the ſet and appointed time. Waiting patiently is the beſt way to ripen pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, impatient wrangling with God is the way to ſet back the promiſes. God loves the force of faith, but he doth exceedingly loath the force of impatience.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) <hi>If we could through over much eagerneſſe haſten a promiſe before its time, it would prove hurtful to us.</hi> An unripe promiſe is like unripe fruit, it doth not tend to nouriſhment, but to diſeaſes. An abortive birth is neither ſo beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, nor ſo ſtrong as that which is brought forth in its full time. A promiſe is then ſweet, when it's brought to paſſe in its due ſeaſon. <hi>He hath made every thing beautiful in his time,</hi> Eccl. 3. 11. 'Tis as true of promiſes, as of providences. Grace hath its maturity as well as nature. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes grow to perfection by tract of time. When the ſet day is come, then, and not till then it hath ful ſhape and proportion.

If a man ſhould reap his field in the blade, or in the ſhooting, he might poſſibly have ſtraw, but he would have no corn. Should God permit the
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:38484:280"/>
impatient Chriſtian to reap the promiſes when they are but in the blade, or in the eare, he would loſe all the benefit and vertue of them. It's mercy to the beleever that God gives him in the promiſed good in the juſt ſeaſon of it. If they ſhould ſtay never ſo little beyond the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, if they ſhould be performed never ſo little before the ſeaſon, the whole benefit of them would be loſt. We ſhall when we come to heaven bleſſe God as much for the timing of his promiſes, as for the making of his promiſes. The fooliſh childe is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

their long bondage. Aſſoone as ever God hath made a promiſe to a ſoule, that ſoule is ſure.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That God will never do it hurt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That God will in due time perform what he hath promiſed. The husbandman, though he do not reap preſently upon the ſowing of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now a violent and impatient eagerneſſe of ſpirit drinks up all the comfort which the ſoul might receive from the promiſe. The promiſe is moſt to ſuch a ſoul as if it had never been made. His wearineſſe in tarrying breeds more torment, then the promiſe doth comfort to his ſoul.</p>
            <p n="4">(4) <hi>It renders the heart leſſe thankful to God for the making of the promiſe.</hi> It is the duty of the children of God to be very thankful for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very promiſe of God. That God that did not owe us any thing, ſhould ſo ſtrongly binde himſelf to us by the cords of a promiſe, this is worthy our heartieſt thankfulneſſe. All the good we expect from God is by vertue of his promiſe. Grace and glory are both wrapt up in promiſes. He that is not thankful for a promiſe, deſerves juſtly the edge of the threatning. Now the heart that is too haſty to have the promiſe ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, will never be ſo thankful as is meet, that the promiſe was made. The anguiſh of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in being delayed, will weaken, if not quite deſtroy the thankfulneſſe of his ſpirit. A tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous wrangling Chriſtian can never be a thankful Chriſtian. Diſcontentment of heart in tarrying for a promiſe, will certainly hinder
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:38484:281"/>
that thankfulneſſe of heart which ſhould be given to God for making a promiſe. This is the ſecond.</p>

Now it is not meet that a free agent ſhould be determined ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for matter or time.

The Prophet mentions this. <hi>Eſay</hi> 25. 9. He that exerciſeth moſt ſaith and hope in waiting for a promiſe, ſhall finde moſt joy in gathering the promiſe.

All Gods promiſes lay a foundation of preſent comfort. But he that never looks after the promiſe, what joy can he have from the promiſe? 'Tis the ſouls beleeving and ſtudying of the promiſe, that draws comfort out of the promiſe.

            </p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt is a fountain ſet open in the Goſpel to all true penitents for the purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away of ſinne and ſpiritual uncleanneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the handling of this Doctrine I ſhall open theſe following particulars.</p>

               <item>1. That Chriſt is the only bath for the purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſpiritual uncleanneſſe.</item>

               <item>5. How Chriſt is ſaid to be a fountaine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. For the firſt. That the purging away of ſpiritual uncleanneſſe is the work of Chriſt. He can do it and none but he is able to do it. This may be evinced by three arguments.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>From expreſſe texts of Scripture.</hi> All pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging work is attributed to Chriſt, and to Chriſt alone. His blood is the only Scripture-bath, the Word of God mentions this and no other. See the following places, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 7. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 5. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. The holy Ghoſt tells us, that Chriſt did by himſelfe purge our ſinnes, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. All the ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents of this ſpiritual purgation came out of the hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of Chriſt alone. No creature contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo much as one herb towards this cleanſing medicine. That in <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 16. where it is ſaid, that by mercy and truth is iniquity purged, is onely to be underſtood as a qualification of the perſon that is purged, not of the meritorious cauſe of purging away ſinne, which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth ever aſcribe to the alſufficient ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Chriſt, who is the onely propitiation for ſinne, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 2.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>From the legal purifications.</hi> Many waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings did God appoint in the Law for the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of thoſe that were legally uncleane. There were two great wayes of ceremonial purificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The blood of the ſacrifices which were offered to God; this was to be ſprinkled by the Prieſts round about the Altar; ſo we read,
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:38484:288"/>
               <hi>Lev.</hi> 1. 5, 11. And the water of ſeparation, of which we read, <hi>Numb.</hi> 19. <hi>init.</hi> where you may ſee how it was to be made, and how uſed. Now what was typified by both theſe, but this ſpiritual purgation of Chriſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">3. <hi>From the baptiſmal waſhing.</hi> God hath appointed Baptiſme as the ſeal of his Covenant under the Goſpel. Water is the outward ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be uſed in the adminiſtration of this Ordinance. What is the meaning of this, but that by the application of Chriſts blood, ſinne is purg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. For the ſecond. Why his blood is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a fountaine. It's called a fountain in five reſpects.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>To ſhew the fulneſſe of his merit.</hi> Fountains are full of water; there is an abundance, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundancy of merit in Jeſus Chriſt. The Prophet would d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aſhing. The Scripture doth mention <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e merit of Chriſt ſometimes by fulneſs, as <hi>John</hi> 1. 14. ſometimes by the terme of abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:38484:288"/>
as <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 17. The grace of Chriſt is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way proportionable to the neceſſity of the ſoul. The ſoul may waſh it ſelfe all over in the blood of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>To ſhew the lastingneſſe of his grace.</hi> The blood of Chriſt doth indure for ever. Streams dry up, veſſels may be emptied, but fountains have a ſpring in themſelves, and can never be emptied, Chriſts blood hath been running for many ages, and yet it runs in as plentiful ſtreams as if it had been but newly opened. It's an ever flowing fountain.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>To ſhew the purity of it.</hi> Streames are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times muddy and dirty, but the fountain is clear. There is not the leaſt mixture of any defilement in the blood of Chriſt. It's compared to chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal for the clearneſſe of it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 1. The blood of Chriſt waſhes away defilement, but it ſelfe is not capable of contracting any defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>To ſhew the freſhneſſe and lively efficacy of it.</hi> Streams may loſe their vertue and efficacy; ſometimes water that is ſweet in the fountaine, is bitter in the ſtreames, eſpecially if thoſe ſtreames be any great diſtance from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. The neerer the ſtreames are to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, the more vertue they have in them, and the fountaine it ſelf hath moſt vertue of all. Chriſts blood is full of efficacy and ſpiritual vigour. It hath not loſt, it cannot loſe that livelineſſe and operativeneſſe which it once had. Thus I have ſhewed you why it's called a fountaine. Before I leave this, let me ſhew you how this fountaine excels all other fountaines,</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>To ſhew the freeneſſe of it.</hi>

It's ſet down indefinitely in the text, <hi>for ſin and for uncleanneſſe,</hi> that is for all ſinne, and for all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe. The pool of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> of which we read, <hi>John</hi> 5. 4. did ſhadow out this; that cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all diſeaſes after the moving of it.

Chriſt, it doth uſually mention ſomething of this nature, <hi>Eſay</hi> 55. 1. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 28. No man will greatly prize either eaſe or reſt, but he that feels his load heavy.</p>

All the complaints which he makes of ſinners remiſneſſe and backwardneſſe in coming to him, are a proof of his readineſſe. Take but two places for this, the one is, <hi>John</hi> 5. 40.

I do not doubt, but by this word he notes the difference between the Law and the Goſpel. Chriſt was a fountain for ſinne and for unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe under the Law, but he was a ſealed foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, he was a typified fountaine, ſhadowed out under the blood of bulls and goats, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther legal purifications; but now he is a fountaine opened, he is clearly and fully diſcovered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſhadows, or types, or any ſuch thing. The fountaine was then covered over with the leaves of many veiles and ſhadows, but now all thoſe are taken away, and the blood of Chriſt appears plainly; the ſtone that formerly lay upon the mouth of the fountaine, is now removed; the ſtreams run ſo clear, that all that read the Goſpel may perfectly ſee it.

The Prophet makes not beleeving in Chriſt, and deſpiſing of Chriſt, equivalent, <hi>Eſay</hi> 53. 1, 3. There is no <hi>medium</hi> between not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving and deſpiſing.</p>
            <p>I have two things to ſay to all that deſpiſe this fountain.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>It is a great ſinne.</hi> 'Tis a deſpiſing of the richeſt love, the deepeſt wiſdom, the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſeſt grace that ever God did or could mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt to the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nnes of men. The waſhing away of ſinne by Chriſts blood is the deepeſt plot of infinite wiſdome, the richeſt piece of unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able grace that ever was manifeſted to the ſons of men. 'Tis that which the Angels do, and ſhall ſtudy for ever.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>The danger is great.</hi> He that deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Chriſt, deſpiſeth cleanſing. <hi>All that hate me love death,</hi> Prov. 8. 38. 'Tis a queſtion diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted by Divines, whether God could have forgiven ſinne without ſatisfaction. Moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude God by his abſolute power might, but now he hath declared himſelf that he will not expiate ſinne any other way, nor by any other meanes but by Chriſt, whom he hath ſet forth to be a propitiation for ſinne, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that refuſeth to waſh in this fountain, muſt of neceſſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y periſh in his own filthineſſe. <hi>Behold ye deſpiſers,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
               <pb n="572" facs="tcp:38484:295"/>
               <hi>and periſh,</hi> Acts 13. 41. God himſelf cannot now ſave him that rejects Chriſts blood.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Let the opening of this fountaine occaſion the opening of other fountain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in all our hearts. Deep calleth unto deep,</hi> Pſal. 42. 7. There are five foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains which the conſideration of the opening of this fountaine ſhould open in the heart of every beleever.</p>
            <p n="1">(1) <hi>A fountain of love.</hi> We ſhould ſet this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine wide open both to God and Chriſt. It was love that ſet open this fountain, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 7. and it ſhould work love in us towards him again; we are commanded <hi>to love</hi> Chriſt. We are threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with a curſe, if we love him not, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 22. The ſtreams of this fountaine, if any thing will cauſe the ſprings of love to overflow in our hearts.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>A fountain of thankfulneſſe.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaking of the redemption we have by Chriſts blood, begins with <hi>Benedictus Deus,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 3. We are unworthy to waſh in this fountaine, if we do not daily render praiſes to God and Chriſt for it. Ordinary thankfulneſſe will not ſerve for ſuch an extraordinary fountain. We owe much thankfulneſſe to God for the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of common water, and much more for this fountain of Grace in the blood of Chriſt. Sing <hi>Davids</hi> ſong of praiſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. <hi>init. Bleſſe the Lord, O my ſoul, and all that is within me bleſſe his holy Name.</hi> Our hearts, if it were poſſible, and our lips too, ſhould be as full of praiſes as this fountain is of grace.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>A fountaine of ſorrow.</hi> This fountain ſhews our guilt. We ſhould not have wanted a fountain for ſin, if we had not fallen into ſin. We ſhould never think on this fountaine for ſinne, but we
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:38484:295"/>
ſhould break forth into ſorrow becauſe of ſin.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>A fountain of faith.</hi> We can neither waſh in this fountain, nor go to it without faith. Chriſt will be to us ſtill as <hi>a fountaine ſealed,</hi> if we do not beleeve in him. <hi>In his Name, through faith in his Name, whoſoever beleeveth in him ſhall have remiſſion of ſins,</hi> Acts 10. 43. This is the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony both of Prophets and Apoſtles. And then,</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>A fountain of humility and ſelf denyal.</hi> By na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we have proud thoughts of our ſelves. All the good which is wrought in us we arrogate to our ſelves. This ſhould teach us to aſcribe all our purification to Chriſt. 'Tis this fountaine that hath cleanſed us if we be cleanſed. The fountain is opened to our hands. We could neither open the fountain, nor come to the fountain, God hath done both. This is the ſecond branch of Exhortation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Make daily uſe of this fountain.</hi> Bathe your ſelves in it continually. Though once waſhing be enough to purge away ſin as to the maine work, yet there will be need of daily purging. Though we need no new ſacrifice for ſinne, yet we need daily applications of the merit of that one ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice upon every miſcarriage.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>When ever you ſee a fountaine of water, think on Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Had we ſpiritual hearts we might think on Chriſt all the day long; few creatures but have ſome memorial of him. He bears the names of his people upon his breaſt. Should not we bear him in our heart by holy thoughts and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diations on him? The more we think on him, the more ſhall we love him, and the more will he communicate his love to us. This is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Uſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. For Conſolation. This Doctrine is the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all comfort to beleevers.</p>

1. <hi>Againſt that bitter fountaine which is in our hearts.</hi> We have a bloody fountain in our nature, which is alwayes running. The droppings of this fountain def<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Gods foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain is more able to cleanſe, then this fountain is to defile. This fountain can drown thy fountain, Chriſt is a greater cleanſer then ſin is a defiler, <hi>Micah</hi> 7. 19. The ſea of Chriſts blood is deep enough to drown all thy ſins; Though thy foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain defile thee daily, yet Chriſts fountain can cleanſe thee daily.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Againſt their inability to make uſe of this fountain.</hi> They are diſcouraged becauſe of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions which lie in their way.
